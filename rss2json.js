The coolest thing ever is being out at the bar on one of the weekends, and seeing someone that I don't know use it. It caught a small following but eventually fizzled out. I still look at that time very fondly, it was a lot of work but good experience.  Anyway since then I haven't really done a side project other than help run the robotics team I coach. But thats about it. I'm ready to get back into it.\n\nHowever, when thinking about starting an open source project I quickly got overwhelmed! I really enjoyed this thread (  ) which really talked about all the times open source software disrupted an industry. If I were to just be starting my own version of a popular commercial product, that I intended to also sell licenses too... I think I'd be a little crazy. It would be hard to beat the established company and they would have the resources to be fair ahead of me constantly. However, if I felt a could make a good product that was completely free, that feels like a different story. \n\nAnyways, really the point of my post was to hopefully explain my thinking and ask some questions.\n\n- Is this a bad view of this?  For example, I have thought about making some monitoring tools that I would find useful at work that I'm sure have been done before. It wouldn't be anything revolutionary but it would hopefully be high quality and free\n- How do you vet the upside of an opensource project? Simply by something you'd think people would like? are there other things I should be considering?\n- Any other feedback?\n\nAnyways, just very excited about some of the possibilities, and wanted to lay out my line of thinking", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1ai71ep/how_do_i_start_a_project/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Agrigento, exceptional recovery at sea: a fragment of the Temple of Zeus resurfaces", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ai5orx", "author": "None"}, {"title": "High-quality landscape 3d model.
