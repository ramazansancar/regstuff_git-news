I've invested $100K into developing this open-source project for our community's benefit. I'd be thrilled if you could check it out here:  We're just getting started, and your insights and feedback are essential for us.\n\nIntroducing Synmetrix (previously known as MLCraft), an innovative open-source data engineering platform and a semantic layer for managing metrics centrally. It's designed to offer a full suite for modeling, integrating, transforming, aggregating, and distributing metric data at scale.\n\nHere are some ways you can leverage Synmetrix:\n\n    * Business Intelligence: Craft metrics and data relationships using a YAML Semantic layer, then apply it across tools like SuperSet, Tableau, PowerBi, or even Excel via a SQL API.\n    * Data Engineering: Dynamically transform data and distribute it to its users.\n    * Data Science: Use Synmetrix as a single source of truth to define window metrics, joins, and custom dimensions.\n    * Anomaly Detection: Keep an eye on your metrics with the \"alerts\" functionality.\n    * Reporting: Streamline report sending via Slack, email, or a straightforward webhook.\n\nThe possibilities extend far beyond this. Be sure to also visit the landing page for more detailed information. We're eagerly looking forward to your feedback to help refine and expand this project. Share your thoughts, suggestions, and any challenges you come across.\nReally appreciate everybody!
