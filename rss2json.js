Based on this  observation, we define a metric called **Block Influence** (**BI**) to gauge the  significance of each layer in LLMs. We then propose a straightforward  pruning approach: layer removal, in which we directly delete the  redundant layers in LLMs based on their BI scores. Experiments  demonstrate that our method, which we call **ShortGPT**, significantly  outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in model pruning.  Moreover, ShortGPT is orthogonal to quantization-like methods, enabling  further reduction in parameters and computation. The ability to achieve  better results through simple layer removal, as opposed to more complex  pruning techniques, suggests a high degree of redundancy in the model  architecture.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1bc187c/shortgpt_layers_in_large_language_models_are_more/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Does Teacher becomes the Medium?", "summary": "Namaskarm Everyone...6 Months Ago i did The Inner engineering Offline In Kolkata......So i want to know during The initiation Process Does  The Teacher Who is conducting the class Becomes The medium Through which Sadhguru initiates Everyone...just curious to know.....

That's because the central fovea in our retina provides the sharpest vision, while details and reliability decrease outside the focal point. In fact, our brain still picks up important information from that blurry periphery. For example, when you're driving and focusing on the traffic light, your peripheral vision can alert you to a pedestrian crossing the street, helping you make safer decisions. Peripheral Vision expands the human visual field, but machines lack this contextual awareness.\n\nResearchers at MIT just announced a new image dataset that simulates peripheral vision in machine learning models. They employed a uniform texture tiling model (TTM), which represents information loss by transforming images to mimic human peripheral vision. Unlike traditional blurring, this model offers a more sophisticated approach, replicating how humans perceive their surroundings. Computer vision models trained on this dataset exhibit significant performance enhancements, particularly in object detection . However, the gap between machine and human performance persists, with machines struggling in the far periphery. [\n\n\n\nModeling peripheral vision can reveal fundamental features influencing human eye movements, providing profound insights into visual scenes and better predictions of human behavior.

And the second video records my field of vision while climbing (with an eye tracker camera). So, the eye tracker camera should technically be \"inside\" the field of the external video. \n\nGoal: Eventually, I would like to \"connect\" these to videos in order to get better object/action recognition (for example, recognize the action of grasping onto a wall climbing hold, from one video, even though it's occluded/not seen in the other video.) I would also like to make a \"heatmap\" which is essentially the hot spots I was mostly looking (an area that my eyes fixated more to will be more red than an area I didn't look much at).\nI would assume that I'll take the data from the eye tracker video (coordinates of where my pupils look within a specific frame), and somehow do some feature matching to connect it to the external video?\n\nI'm not sure how to approach it. Any help would be great. :)\n\n(Extra info that might or not be relevant: I will also  train my costum yolov8 model to detect these actions/objects).
