Is this Normal?", "summary": "Had a conversation with my friend about her job as a CV engineer. It seemed comparatively easier/less annoying compared to other experiences I've heard from online and friends working in ML. I wanted to hear your thoughts on the matter.\n\nAbout my friend's job: She works at a large technology company that exclusively contracts with the United States Government. They provide software solutions for aviation, space, and defense. Her team specifically is focused on doing various CV projects with satellites. Examples include building models to track and map the positions of these satellites.\n\nI expected that her work would mostly be spent collecting, annotating, and pre-processing data. After all, her model inputs are really blurry pictures of objects in space. It felt obvious that there was intense work needed before they could even think about training models.\n\nIt turns out I was half right. There was intense work needed to annotate and pre-process data, just not from her! Her company outsources data annotation to third parties (basically mechanical turks in the likes of Egypt and India) and she has a data-engineering team that does the pre-processing of the images for her.\n\nAll she spends her time doing is literature review for different model architectures and then testing out the different models to find the best results. After that, she presents a power point to her team, and from there they put the model into production.\n\nFrom everything I've learned in school and heard from my friends, this feels abnormal. Her job feels so easy. Shouldn't she be spending time at least pre-processing? And if so, why not?\n\nI hypothesize that maybe her company is just extremely well funded. I doubt that ML engineers outside of Big Tech are afforded this kind of support. My friends who do ML at startups tell me that data engineering is what they do 80% of the time.\n\nWhat are everyone's thoughts on this? Is this a normal workflow for an ML engineer in the industry? What does a \\*normal\\* workflow look like?\n\nNote: This is not meant to take anything away from my friend. She is extremely talented and her team does useful work.

But if they were not wearing any safety hard hat or is just wearing a plain cap wear, they would be considered \"Not Safe\".\n\nI made a custom dataset from \"Peter\" and \"Mark\" in which I captured 70 images of them wearing hard hat in a single color, 70 not wearing at all, then 70 wearing a cap - each. \n\nHere are some additional information of my training procedure:  \n\\- annotated and added augmentation using roboflow and multiplied the images by x3  \n\\- trained, validated, and tested using google collab (300 epoch, downsized to 640x640)\n\nHere are my classes:  \nPeter - Not Safe  \nPeter - Safe  \nMark - Not Safe  \nMark - Safe\n\nI've built my python program already and the detection works, but the problem is that it only detects \"Peter - Not Safe\" and \"Mark - Not Safe\" specifically. I never see the both \"Safe\" at least trigger once.\n\nIn the validation batch and the graphs, it shows great results and even with the test sets it shows that it can detect all classes with 0.9 to 1.0 precision.\n\nIf anyone knows what I can do to further improve it, please do so! I've tried yolov5 before with object detection for users that are wearing hard hat and it went great! This one is difficult as it requires a specific human detection/facial recognition type rather than \"it can detect all in the frame\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/18o09e3/yolov8_accurate_in_validation_and_test_results/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "CNN Sport's top stories of 2023", "summary": "CNN Sport's top stories of 2023&nbsp;&nbsp;", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjMvMTIvMjEvc3BvcnQvY25uLXNwb3J0LXRvcC1zdG9yaWVzLTIwMjMtc3B0LWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5", "published_js": "2023-12-21", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Luton Town captain Tom Lockyer discharged from hospital after suffering cardiac arrest during Premier League match", "summary": "Luton Town captain Tom Lockyer discharged from hospital after suffering cardiac arrest during Premier League match&nbsp;&nbsp;", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjMvMTIvMjEvc3BvcnQvdG9tLWxvY2t5ZXItZGlzY2hhcmdlZC1mcm9tLWhvc3BpdGFsLWx1dG9uLXRvd24tc3B0LWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBbGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjMvMTIvMjEvc3BvcnQvdG9tLWxvY2t5ZXItZGlzY2hhcmdlZC1mcm9tLWhvc3BpdGFsLWx1dG9uLXRvd24tc3B0LWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbA?oc=5", "published_js": "2023-12-21", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Christophe Galtier: Former PSG coach acquitted in discrimination trial", "summary": "Christophe Galtier: Former PSG coach acquitted in discrimination trial&nbsp;&nbsp;", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjMvMTIvMjEvc3BvcnQvY2hyaXN0b3BoZS1nYWx0aWVyLWFjcXVpdHRlZC1kaXNjcmltaW5hdGlvbi10cmlhbC1pbnRsLXNwdC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5", "published_js": "2023-12-21", "author": "None"}]}}};
