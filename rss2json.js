But there should be an easy way for the user to look up dictionary or translate to English so as not to disrupt the flow of reading.\n* Therefore, the tool doesn't have to automatically translate the text to English since that will defeat the purpose of learning. Instead, it should just automatically convert all text bubbles and sound effects to HTML, selectable text, so that user can copy them into their favourite dictionary app, or use a hover dictionary to read them only when they really need.\n* It should be a Chrome extension so that user can easily read on popular manga websites without having to download the mangas.\n* It should preferrably only run on the browser, without connecting to a server or API. This eliminates the trouble of maintaining a server or subscriptinos to external API. I am of the impression that nowadays OCR technology should be simple enough (and browsers are powerful enough) that we can run them in JavaScript inside browsers?\n* OCR doesn't have to be too fast, but should be highly accurate, because otherwise it will be quite troublesome for the user to \"fix\" the wrong OCR and that would disrupt the flow of reading.\n\nI really like the [Mokuro demo](https://kha-white.github.io/manga-demo/), it is almost exactly what I need, except that:\n\n* It runs on Python\n* The flow is different from what I need, but I can manage that part\n\nI'm a fullstack developer myself (mainly JavaScript) but a total newbie in language technology, thus appreciate any pointers from the experts in this group:\n\n1.
