However, the data in the real world is  continuous and dynamic, and ANNs must adapt to novel scenarios while  also retaining the learned knowledge to become lifelong learners. The  ability of humans to excel at these tasks can be attributed to multiple  factors ranging from cognitive computational structures, cognitive  biases, and the multi-memory systems in the brain. We incorporate key  concepts from each of these to design a novel framework, **Dual Cognitive  Architecture** (**DUCA**), which includes multiple sub-systems, implicit and  explicit knowledge representation dichotomy, inductive bias, and a  multi-memory system. The inductive bias learner within DUCA is  instrumental in encoding shape information, effectively countering the  tendency of ANNs to learn local textures. Simultaneously, the inclusion  of a semantic memory submodule facilitates the gradual consolidation of  knowledge, replicating the dynamics observed in fast and slow learning  systems, reminiscent of the principles underpinning the complementary  learning system in human cognition. DUCA shows improvement across  different settings and datasets, and it also exhibits reduced task  recency bias, without the need for extra information. To further test  the versatility of lifelong learning methods on a challenging  distribution shift, we introduce a novel domain-incremental dataset  **DN4IL**. In addition to improving performance on existing benchmarks, DUCA  also demonstrates superior performance on this complex dataset.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/19d2eeb/dual_cognitive_architecture_incorporating_biases/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "I'm trying to figure out why our stream stutters, but not sure where to check first", "summary": "I'm just gonna say it upfront: we definitely need some upgrading in our building and networking, and it could 100% just be that we need a dedicated modem for our little A/V booth.\n\nWe livestream to Facebook and YouTube, but it consistently stutters and isn't nearly as clear as it should be.

By accurately locating and separating objects in images, segmentation enables deeper perception. Meta's SAM from last year was the first foundational model focused on segmentation, excelling at primary spatial perceptions like shapes and edges. However, full perception requires not just segmenting images but also semantic understanding and relationship inference within a single model.\n\nToday, we'd like to share Tokenize Anything via Prompting (TAP) \u2013 a perception-centered foundation model that uses visual prompts (point, box, sketch) to segment, recognize, and describe arbitrary regions simultaneously. This upgrades the prompt-based SAM into a foundation model that efficiently realizes spatial and semantic understanding of any area in a single visual model. [https://github.com/baaivision/tokenize-anything](https://github.com/baaivision/tokenize-anything)\n\nArchitecturally, TAP builds on SAM with a universal image decoder that jointly outputs segmentation masks and semantic tags. The masks handle segmentation while the tags predict corresponding labels and text descriptions. To address the lack of aligned \"segmentation-text\" data, TAP introduces the SemanticSA-1B dataset which implicitly integrates LAION-2B's semantics into SA-1B's segmentation data. Specifically, TAP leverages a 5B-parameter EVA-CLIP model trained on LAION-2B to predict a conceptual distribution over each segmented region in SA-1B. This distribution provides information-maximized semantic supervision to avoid training on highly biased pseudo-labels.\n\nTAP is expected to better support downstream applications, enabling use cases like self-driving, surveillance, or medical imaging.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5gv2cssr3zdc1.jpg?width=1509&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be09c84cc8d1b4acdb16022098c0593c90530777", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/19ct4l4/industry_a_visual_foundation_model_that_can/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "There must be \u2018significant consequences\u2019 for clubs failing to deal with racism in stadiums, says player and union official", "summary": "There must be \u2018significant consequences\u2019 for clubs failing to deal with racism in stadiums, says player and union official&nbsp;&nbsp;", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDEvMjIvc3BvcnQvcGZhLWNoYWlyLW9tYXItYmVja2xlcy1yYWNpc20taW4tZm9vdGJhbGwta2FzZXktcGFsbWVyLXNwdC1pbnRsL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAXNodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDI0LzAxLzIyL3Nwb3J0L3BmYS1jaGFpci1vbWFyLWJlY2tsZXMtcmFjaXNtLWluLWZvb3RiYWxsLWthc2V5LXBhbG1lci1zcHQtaW50bC9pbmRleC5odG1s?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-01-22", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Dayana Yastremska, a qualifier at the Australian Open, has now ...", "summary": "Dayana Yastremska, a qualifier at the Australian Open, has now ...&nbsp;&nbsp;", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDEvMjIvc3BvcnQvZGF5YW5hLXlhc3RyZW1za2EtYXVzdHJhbGlhbi1vcGVuLXRlbm5pcy1zcHQtaW50bC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-01-22", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Drinking and shirtless, Jason Kelce \u2013 aka Chiefs\u2019 \u2018No. 1 hype man ...", "summary": "Drinking and shirtless, Jason Kelce \u2013 aka Chiefs\u2019 \u2018No. 1 hype man ...&nbsp;&nbsp;", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDEvMjIvc3BvcnQvc2hpcnRsZXNzLWphc29uLWtlbGNlLWJpbGxzLWNoaWVmcy1uZmwtc3B0LWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-01-22", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\u2018Wide right\u2019: The two words that haunt Buffalo Bills fans", "summary": "\u2018Wide right\u2019: The two words that haunt Buffalo Bills fans&nbsp;&nbsp;", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDEvMjIvc3BvcnQvYnVmZmFsby1iaWxscy13aWRlLXJpZ2h0LXR5bGVyLWJhc3MtY2hpZWZzLXNwdC1pbnRsL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-01-22", "author": "None"}]}}};
