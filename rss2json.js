Recovering 3D depth from a single image is geometrically ill-posed and  requires scene understanding, so it is not surprising that the rise of  deep learning has led to a breakthrough. The impressive progress of  monocular depth estimators has mirrored the growth in model capacity,  from relatively modest CNNs to large Transformer architectures. Still,  monocular depth estimators tend to struggle when presented with images  with unfamiliar content and layout, since their knowledge of the visual  world is restricted by the data seen during training, and challenged by  zero-shot generalization to new domains. This motivates us to explore  whether the extensive priors captured in recent generative diffusion  models can enable better, more generalizable depth estimation. We  introduce **Marigold**, a method for affine-invariant monocular depth  estimation that is derived from Stable Diffusion and retains its rich  prior knowledge. The estimator can be fine-tuned in a couple of days on a  single GPU using only synthetic training data. It delivers  state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of datasets, including  over 20% performance gains in specific cases.
