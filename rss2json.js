Our goal is to create a tool that promotes a more positive online experience for users.\n\n\nDetails:\n\n\n*Functionality:* Our extension will monitor the websites users visit in real-time. When it detects any content containing hateful speech or negative comments, it will automatically hide or filter out such content from the user's view.\n\n\n\n*Feasibility:* While we're excited about this project, we're also mindful of its feasibility. As two members, we want to ensure that the scope of the project is manageable within the given timeframe and resources. We're open to any suggestions or advice on how to approach the development process efficiently.\n\n\n\n*Technical Considerations:* We're particularly interested in insights on the technical aspects of building such an extension. Should we focus on specific programming languages or frameworks? Are there any existing libraries or APIs that could assist us in detecting and filtering out negative content effectively?\n\n\n\n*Ethical Concerns:* Additionally, we're aware of the ethical implications of content moderation. How can we strike a balance between filtering harmful content and respecting freedom of expression? Are there any best practices or guidelines we should adhere to in this regard?\n\n\n\nAny advice, tips, or resources you can provide would be greatly appreciated. We're eager to learn and make meaningful contributions with this project.

Additionally, the apartments you've selected as comparables for my unit are not suitable matches. I kindly request that you reassess the valuation.\"\n\nFor this project, I've identified several key classifications (around 20) that the model needs to detect, in the above text it should for example find the following classifications.\n\n1. Appraisal too high\n2. Comparison with neighbourhood\n3. Properties used for appraisal not similar\n\nTo tackle this task, I'm considering starting with a pre-trained multilingual model like BERT-multilingual and fine tuning it with a dataset I've classified by hand. However, I'm open to suggestions and would love to hear your thoughts if you've worked on similar projects or have insights into the best approaches for classifying (Dutch) text in NLP. If you know of any similar projects online that would be very helpful as well! I'll be using Python for the implementation since I've been doing a lot of image classification tasks using Python and Tensorflow before.\n\nAny tips about wether to classify it sentence by sentence or the full text at once, how I could best go about this or any other helpful advice is very welcome!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1ao3sqg/analyzing_appraisel_feedback_for_real_estate/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "An \u2018Incredibly Rare\u2019 Roman Funerary Bed Found in London", "summary": "", "link": "https://news.artnet.com/art-world/rare-roman-funerary-discovered-london-2430281", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Advice for an Archaeologist?", "summary": "Hi guys, \n\nI am  an archaeologist and bioarchaeologist (specialty in human remains) currently working in California and doing in-state assignments.
