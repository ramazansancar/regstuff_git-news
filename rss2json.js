It could be anything from a simple thank you, pointing out a typo, mistakes in code snippets, which aspects of the book worked for you (or didn't!) and so on. Reader feedback is essential and especially so for self-published authors.\n\nHappy learning :)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/1b0euzg/text_processing_with_grep_sed_awk_perl_and_ruby/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Getting back to the CV field", "summary": "I did my Masters in EE a few years ago, with specialization in signal processing. I did a couple of courses like image processing, computer vision etc, but ultimately ended up with a job in a totally different field. I've been trying to get back to CV again, but with no luck. I recently started doing the Coursera deep learning and computer vision specializations. The CV specialization from Columbia University does a great job at covering the concepts, but lacking in any programming assignments. The DL specialization was more hands-on, but even that seems like it barely scratches the surface. So here I am with a basic understanding of CV concepts and some hands on programming experience with Tensorflow gained through coursera assignments. I'm not sure what's next. How do I grow my skills/experience in this field? Where do I find side projects that I can work on? There have been so many advancements in this field since I graduated that I have a strong enough foundation to build on. \n\nSo I have been thinking of going back to school, in some form. I cannot give up my day job, so a remote course offered by a university would be great. I was intrigued by the Stanford AI graduate certificate program. It looks like these are the same graduate level courses offered to their students. In particular, I see CS231N (Deep Learning for Computer Vision) and CS231A (Computer Vision) being offered this spring. I'm considering taking these up, so I wanted to see if anybody here has any experience with these courses and how useful they would be in helping me pivot to the CV field. I'm assuming these are more in-depth than any of the popular Coursera courses. But they cost a lot of money, so I want to cover all bases and be sure of the value that these courses add before enrolling. Thanks for any and all feedback.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1b0wdmg/getting_back_to_the_cv_field/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "During Mahashivrati, do we stay awake from 6pm - 6am ist time only or in our time zone?", "summary": "It would be 4:30am - 4:30pm in my time zone", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Sadhguru/comments/1b0lcp2/during_mahashivrati_do_we_stay_awake_from_6pm_6am/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "I made a Daily Question website for Couples!", "summary": "", "link": "https://mehmetkahya0.github.io/daily-questions-web/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "Everton\u2019s 10-point Premier League deduction reduced following appeal to move club up to 15th in table", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Everton\u2019s 10-point Premier League deduction reduced following appeal to move club up to 15th in table</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDIvMjYvc3BvcnQvZXZlcnRvbi1wcmVtaWVyLWxlYWd1ZS1zYW5jdGlvbi1yZWR1Y2VkLWZvbGxvd2luZy1hcHBlYWwtc3B0LWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBdWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjQvMDIvMjYvc3BvcnQvZXZlcnRvbi1wcmVtaWVyLWxlYWd1ZS1zYW5jdGlvbi1yZWR1Y2VkLWZvbGxvd2luZy1hcHBlYWwtc3B0LWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-02-26", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Canadians and Russians file appeals on re-ranking of 2022 Winter Olympics figure skating team event", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Canadians and Russians file appeals on re-ranking of 2022 Winter Olympics figure skating team event</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDIvMjYvc3BvcnQvY2FuYWRhLXJ1c3NpYS1maWd1cmUtc2thdGluZy13aW50ZXItb2x5bXBpY3Mtc3B0LWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBaWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjQvMDIvMjYvc3BvcnQvY2FuYWRhLXJ1c3NpYS1maWd1cmUtc2thdGluZy13aW50ZXItb2x5bXBpY3Mtc3B0LWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-02-26", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Australia women\u2019s goalkeeper jerseys finally go on sale \u2013 six months after the World Cup", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Australia women\u2019s goalkeeper jerseys finally go on sale \u2013 six months after the World Cup</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDIvMjYvc3BvcnQvYXVzdHJhbGlhLW5pa2UtZ29hbGtlZXBlci1qZXJzZXktbWFja2VuemllLWFybm9sZC1zcHQtaW50bC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFuaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyNC8wMi8yNi9zcG9ydC9hdXN0cmFsaWEtbmlrZS1nb2Fsa2VlcGVyLWplcnNleS1tYWNrZW56aWUtYXJub2xkLXNwdC1pbnRsL2luZGV4Lmh0bWw?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-02-26", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Jake Knapp: Two years ago, he was a nightclub bouncer.
