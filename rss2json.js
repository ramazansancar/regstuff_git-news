One of the things she said was stressed during her training at the ashram in Coimbatore was that he didn\u2019t want his words misinterpreted or modified. He was harsh in his expectations that they as teachers not add their own words or experience, as he wants the practices to remain as unchanged as possible for the longest time possible. \n\nIt\u2019s why, when taught our practices we are told to ask questions of the Isha practice support people rather than asking others who are not Isha trained. And of course we often throw that directive out the window when we ask each other questions here. \n\nI believe this extends to any conclusions we reach about what we are doing or experiencing. Best always to go back to the source. (I most definitely include myself here - I\u2019m truly not intending to browbeat anyone).\n\nAs an example, I recently read a statement written here about how one gets to experience what Sadhguru talks about out when he said our practices act as trampolines so we can \u201csee over the wall\u201d. He also discusses how one opens our third eye - and he said the third eye opens either from emptying ourselves so completely of ourselves that the door to the eye implodes, or we become so full of energy that the door explodes outward. \n\nThe method he said for doing either of those things required commitment to our practices. \n\nWhat I do not recall him ever saying was that, outside of Shambhavi Mahamudra, we needed to do x, y, and z practices before it\u2019ll happen. Doesn\u2019t mean he never said it; I just never heard or read him say such a thing. (Please correct me on this if he actually did, and if so please provide a cite so I can read/hear him say it himself)\n\nSuch assumptions and conclusions will always be posted in this sub because we are all people, doing people things. It\u2019s in our nature to be curious and to speculate. \n\nBut that\u2019s just one example of conclusions discussed here and for that reason I would suggest it might be better if we try to just post actual quotes and vids from Sadhguru. Such would be far more helpful and useful than listening to me or anyone else talk about stuff from a student\u2019s point of view.
