I am talking about your present life so that you can live this life fruitfully. Do not wait for me to PULL THE PLUG, living a stupid life until then. I am teaching you practices and asking you to take your life into your hands so that you live gracefully and sensibly. Take care of your own life, work towards realization so that you live an elevated life here.\u201d\n\nLink to whole article:  ", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Sadhguru/comments/1bj8qvq/what_does_sadhguru_mean_when_he_says_pull_the/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "3 newfound tombs might contain the bodies of elites from the Jurchen Jin Dynasty, which ruled China between 1115 and 1234", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/lavish-800-year-old-tombs-in-china-may-hold-remains-of-great-jin-dynasty-elites", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Intriguing Skull Modifications Discovered in Viking Women", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.medievalists.net/2024/03/skull-modifications-viking-women/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc51", "summary": "", "link": "https://v.redd.it/devknijpwhpc1", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Migrant workers exploited, abused in Italy\u2019s prized fine wine vineyards", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2024/3/19/migrant-workers-exploited-abused-in-italys-prized-fine-wine-vineyards", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "Tennis stars voice support for Aryna Sabalenka after her boyfriend\u2019s death", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Tennis stars voice support for Aryna Sabalenka after her boyfriend\u2019s death</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDMvMjAvc3BvcnQvYXJ5bmEtc2FiYWxlbmthLW1pYW1pLW9wZW4tdGVubmlzLXNwdC1pbnRsL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAVNodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDI0LzAzLzIwL3Nwb3J0L2FyeW5hLXNhYmFsZW5rYS1taWFtaS1vcGVuLXRlbm5pcy1zcHQtaW50bA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-03-20", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Organizers of Paris 2024 Olympics announce initiatives to offer athletes free condoms and mental health resources", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Organizers of Paris 2024 Olympics announce initiatives to offer athletes free condoms and mental health resources</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDMvMTkvc3BvcnQvcGFyaXMtMjAyNC1vbHltcGljcy1mcmVlLWNvbmRvbXMtbWVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC1yZXNvdXJjZXMtc3B0LWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBamh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjQvMDMvMTkvc3BvcnQvcGFyaXMtMjAyNC1vbHltcGljcy1mcmVlLWNvbmRvbXMtbWVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC1yZXNvdXJjZXMtc3B0LWludGw?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-03-19", "author": "None"}]}}};
