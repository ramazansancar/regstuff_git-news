I don't know how to put it so that you understand it more deeply.\n\nThere is a spiritual practice called ubungoma. We are told that this is a traditional practice, a part of our culture. People who practice this type of Spirituality are called sangomas.\n\nBasically, what sangomas do is that they receive messages from ancestors, we are told. They use bones when people consult. They throw the bones down, read the bones, tell you your problems, and offer you solutions on how to solve your problems.\n\nThis can be financial problems, health problems, or any other life problems. Now how do people become sangomas? There is something dodgy happening. What happens is that if you're a spiritual person, or spiritually gifted, you will be told by your friends, family and even strangers, they will tell you or advice you to consult a sangoma.\n\nWhen you get to a sangoma, they will throw their bones down and tell you that your ancestors wants you to also become a sangoma. You have to be initiated into this practice of ubungoma.\n\nThen you'll undergo all sorts of ancestral rituals to become a sangoma. Animal sacrifices are the main aspect of this practice. After becoming a sangoma, you have to sacrifice animals every year to appease the ancestors.\n\nWhen people consult with you seeking to better their lives, you as a sangoma you tell them that their ancestors are not happy, and therefore they need to do ancestral ceremonies (animal sacrifices) in their homes so that everything goes well and smooth in their lives.\n\nIf you refuse to become a sangoma, you are then threatened with all types of misfortunes, accidents, illnesses and even death. I call it spiritual coercion. Ancestors can just punish you, saying they're doing it because you're not practicing your culture.\n\nSo I want to know if something like also happen somewhere else in the world, or is it just here in South Africa. Is there anything like this where you live? And overall, what are your thoughts on this type of spiritual practice?\n\nI am curious to hear your thoughts on this one.

From robots to self-driving cars, environmental perception is critical for safe and reliable operation. Vision works reasonably well in well-lit settings but falters after sundown or in foul weather. Thermal imaging offers a solution yet suffers from ghosting artifacts that obscure texture details.   \nAn exciting new technique called Heat-Assisted Detection and Ranging (HADAR) promises to overcome these limitations. Featured on the cover of Nature, HADAR leverages machinelearning algorithms to decouple key physical properties from raw thermal data. Specifically, it separates temperature (T, physical status), emissivity (e, material fingerprint), and texture (X, surface geometry). Researchers collected a dataset of over 180,000 paired thermal and visible light images with manual annotations across varying times, locations, and visibility conditions. This empowers reliable identification and depth estimation even for uniform temperature regions where traditional thermal imaging fails. [  \nThe implications are profound. HADAR effectively gives machines \"super vision,\" able to perceive rich textures and scene depths even in total darkness. This could benefit autonomous navigation, precision agriculture, wildlife monitoring, search and rescue, and other applications requiring reliable 24/7 operation. It helps overcome not only darkness but also other impediments like fog, smoke, and precipitation.   \nHADAR serves as an inspiring example of how cross-disciplinary research combining thermal physics, computer vision, and machine learning can push the boundaries of environmental perception for real-world systems. Machines that can see as well at midnight as at noon will open new frontiers for reliable automation across many industries. We eagerly look forward to seeing what emerging capabilities this line of research unlocks next.\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1ak43rf/giving_machines_daybright_vision_in_the_dark/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "tdo: cli note-taking system that just works", "summary": "Hi r/commandline,\n\nI have explored almost every other note taking system under the sun, including some neovim plugins but all of them had way too many features and configurations than what I needed, so I finally gave up and wrote my own.\n\nIt uses a simple structure and no feature bloat.\nThe goal is to write and categorize notes in markdown and easily review them.\n\nI have been happily using this system for the past few weeks and finally decided to share it! \n\nCheck out the README for more details", "link": "https://github.com/2KAbhishek/tdo", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Tunnel that could lead to Cleopatra's Tomb is 'geometric miracle'", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.jpost.com/archaeology/article-785360", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Massachusetts police K9 tracks scent for over 2 miles to find missing 12-year-old in freezing cold", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/us/massachusetts-police-k9-tracks-scent-2-miles-find-missing-12-year-old-freezing-cold", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Trio wins $700K Vesuvius Challenge grand prize for deciphering ancient scroll", "summary": "", "link": "https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/02/trio-wins-700k-vesuvius-challenge-grand-prize-for-deciphering-ancient-scroll/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "typing-game-cli - Command line game to practice your typing speed.", "summary": "", "link": "https://v.redd.it/rzjyrlbirugc1", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A single simple patch is all you need for AI-generated image detection", "summary": "Our lab has recently been exploring AI-generated image detection, specifically distinguishing whether an image is real or AI-generated. We made an interesting discovery: by extracting high-frequency noise information using SRM from the simplest patch found in the image and feeding it into a binary classifier, excellent results can be achieved. Moreover, the method is highly robust with strong generalization capabilities. We have named this method Single Simple Patch (SSP), and the entire process is illustrated in the diagram below. For the technical details, please refer to [ \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n\n\nTaking some images as examples, the simplest patches are mostly close to solid colors. It is these patches that appear visually close to solid colors, where the high-frequency noise extracted by SRM conceals the password for determining authenticity. The top three rows represent images generated by Midjourney, while the bottom three rows represent real images from ImageNet. \n\n\n\nThe results on the GenImage dataset are shown in the table below. The training was conducted on images generated by SDv1.4, and testing was performed on images generated by different generators. Our SSP method achieved promising performance, demonstrating robust cross-generator generalization capabilities. \n\n\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1ajx8hs/a_single_simple_patch_is_all_you_need_for/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Thinking of going for Angamardana or Surya kriya", "summary": "Namaskaram,\n\nI am thinking of attending the angamardana program along with bhuta shuddhi.

I think this would be better for me than angamardana at least right now. My health and constitution aren\u2019t bad, but lately poor sleep and other factors have me not at 100%. I was thinking angamardana might be a good remedy and to help build up my health and fitness levels. Now that I see Surya kriya is happening near me I don\u2019t feel the pressure that I have to go for angmardana specifically, I just wanted some Hatha practice to do. I feel Surya kriya might be the right practice for me at least right now. And I can always go for angamardana later when I feel more confident that it\u2019ll do my body some good.
