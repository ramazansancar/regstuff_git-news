Is this a good advice to publically say for someone in his position? \n\nI don't follow anybody, with my own experience, I learned that a person without self confidence is good for nothing. When you don't respect yourself or love yourself, not only you treat yourself poorly, others treat you poorly; and even God won't help you. \nI suffer the most when I'm  not confident. I enjoy happiness, calmness and peace when I am self confident. \n\nNow when someone like Sadhguru whom I admire says something like this, this kind of annoys me because: \nHe says clearly to not be self confident and have clarity. But when asked how to build clarity, there is no clear answer. \n\nI also noticed that Sadhguru doesn't like anything 'Western'. Be it clothing, words, language etc. He constantly bashes the terms like  confidence, self esteem, self help etc. He uses English to reach people. It is good to love your own culture but it is not so nice to discard other cultures. \n\nIn my opinion, every culture has something to learn from. We should not deisrespect any culture. \n\nSwami Vivekananda has said: Anything which makes you weak, treat it as poison. \nNow this sounds fair and it relates with me.\n\nEventhough I like Sadhguru, I can't agree with everything he says (atleast what's published on Youtube.)\n\nShare your thoughts, Am I interpreting it the wrong way?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Sadhguru/comments/1aekj8n/you_dont_have_to_be_self_confident_you_just_need/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The interview for the SLP MSc at Edinburgh", "summary": "I'll be scheduling an interview as part of the application process for the Speech and Language Processing MSc at the University of Edinburgh.
