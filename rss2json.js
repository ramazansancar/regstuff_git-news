In addition to the inefficiency of LLMs in self-assessment,  we also observe that LLMs struggle to revisit their predictions despite  receiving explicit negative feedback. Therefore, We propose **Mirror**, a  Multiple-perspective self-reflection method for knowledge-rich  reasoning, to avoid getting stuck at a particular reflection iteration.  Mirror enables LLMs to reflect from multiple-perspective clues, achieved  through a heuristic interaction between a **Navigator** and a **Reasoner**. It  guides agents toward diverse yet plausibly reliable reasoning trajectory  without access to ground truth by encouraging (1) diversity of  directions generated by Navigator and (2) agreement among strategically  induced perturbations in responses generated by the Reasoner. The  experiments on five reasoning datasets demonstrate that Mirror's  superiority over several contemporary self-reflection approaches.

How do you perceive the relationship between spiritual leaders when they seem to indirectly address each other?\n\nFurthermore, Sri M claims to have had remarkable experiences in his past lives, including being one of Krishna's Gopis, meeting Buddha and Mahavir, being a disciple of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and Sadashiva Brahmendra, and even meditating with Mahavatar Babaji centuries ago. It seems all these masters had no other job but to keep meeting him every lifetime and still he is taking rebirths one after another.

I don\u2019t plan on using it heavily; just for watching movies and anime on VLC via network sharing from Windows, browsing images, playing audio, and basic functionality for apps like Google Drive, YouTube, and general browsing.\n\nTo be honest, my main goals are:\n\n* To be able to watch Blu-rays from VLC shared on a network without any hitches (currently, VLC barely plays the video and it just lags like crazy).\n\n* Just to be able to use it to surf the internet to do silly stuff and reminisce about the old days (nothing too serious like banking and stuff).\n\n* To be able to access some basic apps without crashing (like Drive, Photos, YouTube, etc.).\n\n* Maybe play some games through emulation (like back then, I used to play Pok\u00e9mon Black 2 on this using Drastic like crazy when my DS broke).\n\nAnd mainly, to have that old Android nostalgic feel, so something very similar to Android 4.4\u2019s style, looks, and feel. Just a solution that isn\u2019t too resource-intensive and is efficient on the device.\n\nMaybe, I could also install Termux and mess around with it's APIs and some Linux commands and tools?\n\nAlso, I\u2019m quite fond of the Gallery app that comes with it (Version 4.4.4-T561XXU0AQI2). Would it be feasible or even possible to repackage this system app as a standalone APK that I could then install on the new ROM?\n\nThanks in advance for any help or suggestions!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/androidafterlife/comments/1bd1cp5/any_glimmer_of_hope_for_my_old_samsung_galaxy_tab/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Windows activity logger", "summary": "Hey there, I'm looking for a tool that let's me log wich app I used for wich time.
