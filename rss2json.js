Without pursuing novel technical  modules, we aim to build a simple yet powerful foundation model dealing  with any images under any circumstances. To this end, we scale up the  dataset by designing a data engine to collect and automatically annotate  large-scale unlabeled data (\\~62M), which significantly enlarges the  data coverage and thus is able to reduce the generalization error. We  investigate two simple yet effective strategies that make data  scaling-up promising. First, a more challenging optimization target is  created by leveraging data augmentation tools. It compels the model to  actively seek extra visual knowledge and acquire robust representations.  Second, an auxiliary supervision is developed to enforce the model to  inherit rich semantic priors from pre-trained encoders. We evaluate its  zero-shot capabilities extensively, including six public datasets and  randomly captured photos. It demonstrates impressive generalization  ability. Further, through fine-tuning it with metric depth information  from NYUv2 and KITTI, new SOTAs are set. Our better depth model also  results in a better depth-conditioned ControlNet. Our models are  released at [this https URL](https://github.com/LiheYoung/Depth-Anything).", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/19ejtqo/depth_anything_unleashing_the_power_of_largescale/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How to train ViT on smaller datasets ?
