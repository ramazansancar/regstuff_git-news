Being enlightened doesn't necessarily mean that one is a chakreshwara. The example Sadhguru used was that Gautama the buddha's method only included the path of awareness, which is just 1 of the 112 methods that Shiva departed to his disciples. Sadhguru said somewhere that though there was a galaxy of enlightened beings at one point in time, at most there would not have been more than a few dozen throughout history (including those that he was aware of ) that had attained to chakreshwara. In terms of our limited experience of life, even if we look at in terms of face value rather than looking at it on the energy level, it is clearly clearly evident that Sadhguru is the most sensible being on the planet. It gives me shivers to think that there were others in human history who had attained to chakreshwara and were at the same stature that Sadhguru is currently at, but they didn't get the opportunity to influence humanity in such a way that would have prevented many of the calamities created by human beings. Sadhguru is probably the first chakreshwara in human history who was given a microphone to speak to the whole world. My thinking is that if can create the conditions for it, we can make way for others of that level of capability. Even if we ourselves are not capable of that, the least we can do is nurture others in that direction.

However, due to the  enormous diversity in input-output formats in the vision domain,  existing general-purpose models fail to successfully integrate  segmentation and multi-image inputs with coarse-level tasks into a  single framework. In this work, we introduce **VistaLLM**, a powerful visual  system that addresses coarse- and fine-grained VL tasks over single and  multiple input images using a unified framework. VistaLLM utilizes an  instruction-guided image tokenizer that filters global embeddings using  task descriptions to extract compressed and refined features from  numerous images. Moreover, VistaLLM employs a gradient-aware adaptive  sampling technique to represent binary segmentation masks as sequences,  significantly improving over previously used uniform sampling. To  bolster the desired capability of VistaLLM, we curate CoinIt, a  comprehensive coarse-to-fine instruction tuning dataset with 6.8M  samples. We also address the lack of multi-image grounding datasets by  introducing a novel task, AttCoSeg (Attribute-level Co-Segmentation),  which boosts the model's reasoning and grounding capability over  multiple input images. Extensive experiments on a wide range of V- and  VL tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of VistaLLM by achieving  consistent state-of-the-art performance over strong baselines across all  downstream tasks.
