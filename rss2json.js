I'm a beginner with computer vision systems and for a project I need to create a system that can measure the vertical displacement of a wire automatically. This wire is a black horizontal wire. The camera will be at a fixed distance from the wire and after the wire moves up and down again, it will vibrate till rest.\n\nSo I tried messing around with chatgpt and the openCV library from python. But I want some general advice or some things that I can try to make it.  \n\n\nInitially I tried to just track the wire with edge detection, but since the wire has an upper and lower edge, it sometimes switches, even though I wrote to always select the upper edge. Also it didn't seem to work well when the background contrast is not high. I made it to manually select a ROI to follow the wire, but when I tried to do it automatically looking for the wire, it didn't work that well (couldn't always find the wire, especially not with noisy backgrounds).  \n\n\nThen I tried using an object and put it on the wire and used template matching. It does work fast and accurate, but again I'm selecting the template manually and my professor also said that the shape of the object is not optimal (it's a stick, so a cylinder) and that I should try a sphere, because even with different angles, the image will always be a circle in 2D and the middle point of a sphere is consistent or something like that. He also recommended me to use mocap markers, since they are made from reflective material and if I use an IR light+camera, that they will appear very bright white, so that they should be easily trackable. So I'm thinking to just take 2 white pingpong balls and slap it on a stick, so that I just always look for the brightest object and circle forms to track. If I have 2, then I can also save the pixel distance between the midpoints from the 1st frame and at the end, when I save the data points, I just convert it from \"px\" to \"mm\" because the distance from midpoint to midpoint would be fixed e.g. 5cm.   \n\n\nThis is just what I'm thinking to approach this problem, of course the programming would probably be quite a bit harder. While most of it works on a dark uniform background with the pingpong balls (just the tracking), when I try using a noisy background, the balls don't get detected and it also appears to run very slow. I'm wondering if I should just wait till I get those reflective markers or maybe try a different approach? Also with this approach, I feel like environmental factors like sunlight or a lamp in the background might also disrupt the accuracy of the tracking, since they would also appear bright on the video. I'm not sure if other noise can be ignored though.  \n\n\nIf anyone has any tips or a different approach, it would be very much appreciated!

Basically, I have a list of GPU and GPUs, which look like \"Intel I5 12000HX\" and \"Nvidia Geforce RTX 3050 6Go\", things you mostly know already.\n\nI want to crawl ebay and compare this list to what's in the text of the listed items: description, title, characteristics etc.\n\nThe challenge is obviously that people don't fill-in the items properly. Then sometimes do typos, they put spaces where they shouldn't (12000HS becomes 12000-HS\" for example). Sometimes they type-in references that don't even exist (for this one, can't do that much). They also sometimes give only approximate info, e.g. \"Intel Core i5 11th Gen\" which could be like 5 different CPUs.\n\nThe way I am doing it now is simply cleaning up the text, and then making regexes to try to match as many CPUs as I can, but since there are thousands of components, I can't possibly write them all, let alone take into account the typos.\n\nThat's why I'm asking here for more advanced techniques that could achieve what I can. You have to know that CPU/GPU references can be really close to each other in Levenstein distance, but have really different capabilities.\n\nI have tried using a powerful LLM (ChatGPT 3.5), and unsurprisingly it works very well, and is able to find the CPU in the postings even if it's not clear. Maybe I can fine-tune my own tiny LLM to perform well on these tasks ? Maybe I can just work with NER tools like BERT that are probably easier to tune than an LLM ?\n\nThanks for reading this far, curious about what you guys think.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1be8489/how_to_find_specific_references_of_items_in_a_text/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "The Players Championship 2024: How to watch Scottie Scheffler\u2019s bid to make history at golf\u2019s \u2018fifth major\u2019", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">The Players Championship 2024: How to watch Scottie Scheffler\u2019s bid to make history at golf\u2019s \u2018fifth major\u2019</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDMvMTQvc3BvcnQvaG93LXRvLXdhdGNoLXBsYXllcnMtY2hhbXBpb25zaGlwLTIwMjQtc3B0LWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBY2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjQvMDMvMTQvc3BvcnQvaG93LXRvLXdhdGNoLXBsYXllcnMtY2hhbXBpb25zaGlwLTIwMjQtc3B0LWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-03-14", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Following homophobic chanting, three Austrian soccer players left off national team", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Following homophobic chanting, three Austrian soccer players left off national team</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDMvMTQvc3BvcnQvYXVzdHJpYW4tc29jY2VyLXJhcGlkLXZpZW5uYS1ob21vcGhvYmljLWNoYW50aW5nLXNwdC1pbnRsL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAW1odHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDI0LzAzLzE0L3Nwb3J0L2F1c3RyaWFuLXNvY2Nlci1yYXBpZC12aWVubmEtaG9tb3Bob2JpYy1jaGFudGluZy1zcHQtaW50bC9pbmRleC5odG1s?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-03-14", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Bernhard Langer: Pickleball injury forces golfer to miss The Masters", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Bernhard Langer: Pickleball injury forces golfer to miss The Masters</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDMvMTMvc3BvcnQvYmVybmhhcmQtbGFuZ2VyLXBpY2tsZWJhbGwtdGhlLW1hc3RlcnMtZ29sZi1zcHQtaW50bC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-03-13", "author": "None"}]}}};
