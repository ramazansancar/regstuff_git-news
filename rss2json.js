For every datapoint i have a different  number of Inputs Images. What are appropriate approaches for submitting them into the model and how could I handle different numbers of imputimages per datapoint? Is it even possible or should I rethink my approach predicting the costs? I sadly couldn't find a Solution till now. I would be greatful for some research papers and tips \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1b5fyco/multiinputcostprediction/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The models that can be trained with TensorFlow", "summary": "Hello everyone, this is my project, you can use tensorflow to train these models.\n\nThe models can be found at [\n\nThe tutorial can be found at [", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1b5etoc/the_models_that_can_be_trained_with_tensorflow/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Arctic doomsday vault gets record batch of crop seeds from twenty-three seed banks worldwide", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.arctictoday.com/arctic-doomsday-vault-gets-record-batch-of-crop-seeds/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Books/Courses to learn Traditional CV Geometry", "summary": "Could you guys please recommend me books/courses/youtube playlists that cover traditional computer vision in depth.
