I both experienced &amp; saw the tremendous amounts of Trauma that 2020\u2019s COVID Created across the globe.  Realizing that every Human who Survives Childhood \u2013 let alone lived thru the entire COVID Pandemic \u2013 has at least been exposed to a potentially Traumatic Event, I have wanted to Create this short list since at least 2020, finally getting this out on New Year\u2019s Eve going into 2024.\r  \n\r  \nAfter my MH Career there weren\u2019t many Hacks I\u2019d not heard of in some form or another, so there is a specific Concept that when my current MH Counselor mentioned this to me it hit me like a ton of bricks (e.g., a Personal Epiphany like the other 2) &amp; is something I keep coming back to, at least Daily.  Inspired by this, I wanted to present 2 of the best MH Hack Epiphanies I ever had, that I kept coming back to time &amp; again to Help so very many Clients for so many Reasons.  I kept it short at a page-ish long, this very short list of the following 3 MH Hacks.  In honor, I\u2019ll start w/ the newest Hack I got from my own MH Counselor I\u2019m fortunate enough to have Working w/ me, &amp; work to the 2 Epiphanies I got a decade or more ago, to whit:\r  \n\r  \n\\#1 Practicing \u201cMastery\u201d is the term that my current MH Counselor Inspired me w/, &amp; is a very pro-MH Exercise \u2013 e.g., flushing the Cortisol, etc. from our Nervous/NeuroLogical System.  He defined it as, \u201ca Durable Effectiveness in One\u2019s Daily Life.\u201d  I think the closest I came was suggesting to everyone that they engage w/ some sort of Activity they Enjoy/inJoy, or literally \u201cBring Joy w/in\u201d, on the Daily, when particularly Stressed out to MAX, etc.  Whilst you may inJoy Gardening, Creating or engaging w/ Art or Music, Mechanical tinkering, Tai Chi or Yoga, Video Games, Cooking, or whatever else, the idea of \u201cMastery\u201d broadens that out to include things like Cleaning, re-Organizing, &amp;c.  I also stressed to my Clients how important ASC\u2019s/Altered States of Consciousness can be \u2013 whether it be in Prayer, Meditation, Exercise, Singing, &amp;c. \u2013 but particularly FLOW States, States of Ecstasy, &amp; Transcendence.  Expressing Mastery often correlates w/ such ASC\u2019s, and they all encourage Mental Health.  It\u2019s encouraging to know that simply Finishing something (e.g., Cooking) can be 1 of countless super easy ways to Feel, Practice, &amp; Express Mastery for one\u2019s self.  It can help to Affirm such whilst engaging, e.g., \u201cThis is my Self-Care\u201d if you wanna be Clinical about it, etc.\r  \n\r  \n\\#2 When I worked at the last Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facility a decade or so ago, I had a Weekly Meditation Class I taught.  It was only attended by 2 of the Residents, but as they were 2 of the Residents who struggled most w/ DisAbling MH Conditions, I felt it worth my Time &amp; Energy to continue for the 2ish years I did.  During 1 particular Meditation Class, 1 of the Residents began to spike in MH Anxieties as she DeCompensated.  I had an Epiphany that I jokingly refer to as my \u201cAnti-Anxiety Meditation\u201d that I Shared w/ her then &amp; that I\u2019m honored to Share w/ you now:\r  \n\r  \nTake Slow, Calm, Deep Breaths, focusing simply on the Breath and each of those 4 Words.  There are no \u201cRules\u201d in Meditation, so feel free to Ignore or Change as you Will.  In the Experience of myself &amp; others, it seems best to Focus on each Word w/ either an Inhalation or Exhalation.  If Anxiety requires our Breathing to become Rapid, Tense, &amp; Shallow (and it does \u2013 try getting Anxious w/o them!), then Focusing on each Word w/ each Breath \u2013 not unlike a Mantra from the Eastern Traditions \u2013 can literally Hack your Nervous System from Experiencing Anxiety!  To Clarify, my Way is to begin on the Inhalation \u201cSlow\u201dly, Exhaling \u201cCalm\u201dly, Breathing in \u201cDeep\u201dly, &amp; finally Exhaling the word \u201cBreaths\u201d before returning to \u201cSlow\u201d on the next Inhalation, &amp;c.  Don\u2019t Stress or cause Tension as you do them \u2013 that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to eliminate.  If you have other Distracting Thoughts, simply view them as a hazy Cloud that passes on by or fades away as you gently return to Slow, Calm, Deep, Breaths. You can do this anywhere you feel Anxiety, eyes open, even in a crowded subway!  Doing this for 30 seconds or more should yield immediate &amp; notable Results.  To re-summarize:  \nSlow (inhale)\r  \nCalm (exhale)\r  \nDeep (inhale)\r  \nBreaths (exhale)\r  \n(repeat as needed)\r  \n\r  \n\\#3 Here\u2019s an early Epiphany I got when I was a teenager that Solved my being too much of a Worry Wart.

These clay time capsules, some bearing the whispers of long-dead civilizations, remained tantalizingly mute, their languages lost to the sands of time. Until now.\n\nIn a breakthrough that rewrites the rules of linguistic archaeology, researchers have harnessed the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to decipher cuneiform with an astonishing 98% accuracy \u2013 even without the aid of a Rosetta Stone. This leap forward represents not just a technological marvel, but a portal into the unknown, promising to resurrect lost languages and illuminate the lives of our distant ancestors.\n\nThe project, spearheaded by a team at Bar-Ilan University in Israel, trained its AI on a massive dataset of previously translated cuneiform tablets, along with Akkadian, the dominant language of ancient Mesopotamia. By analyzing patterns and statistical relationships between symbols and their associated meanings, the AI developed its own understanding of the language. This self-taught fluency, akin to how children learn their native tongue, allowed the AI to tackle previously untranslated texts with astonishing accuracy.\n\nImagine holding a tablet, baked in Mesopotamian sunlight 5,000 years ago, its surface etched with cryptic symbols. Now, with a click, the AI whispers the tablet's secrets in your ear. You hear prayers to forgotten gods, royal decrees carved in the cuneiform script, and mundane records of daily life, revealing the very pulse of a civilization long vanished.\n\nBut the implications extend far beyond mere translation. The AI's ability to analyze thousands of tablets simultaneously promises to unlock deeper insights into ancient cultures. We can now map trade routes, analyze legal systems, and understand religious beliefs in ways never before possible. Imagine reconstructing the economic networks that fuelled Mesopotamian empires, or piecing together the complex theology of early Babylonian priests.\n\nThe potential for rewriting history is palpable. For millennia, our understanding of ancient Mesopotamia has been fragmented, relying on the handful of deciphered tablets and archaeological scraps. Now, with a vast library of voices suddenly brought to light, the picture comes into sharper focus. We can trace the evolution of languages, witness the rise and fall of empires, and even hear the echoes of everyday life from the dawn of civilization.\n\nOf course, challenges remain. The AI, while remarkably accurate, isn't infallible. Subtle nuances of meaning and cultural context can still elude its grasp. Human linguists and historians remain crucial partners in interpreting the nuances of these ancient texts. Nonetheless, the AI's remarkable feat sets a new standard for the field.\n\nWhile the Rosetta Stone, the key that unlocked Egyptian hieroglyphics, will forever hold its place in history, its reign as the sole gateway to lost languages is over. AI has opened a new door, not just to specific languages, but to a forgotten world waiting to be rediscovered. One clay tablet at a time, the whispers of the past are rising, and with them, the promise of a richer, more complete understanding of who we are and where we came from.\n\n**References:**\n\n* Bisk, Y., Reichert, N., &amp; Tsur, O.

Something that you have decided you will do your best to be at all times.\n\nThis has been touched by sadhguru many many times but the thing is, generally in youtube and other platforms where his free content is available, we seekers are generally not the target audience. We need something that makes us stick to being unwavering.\n\nIn inner engineering, we got a number of things that we can be unwavering about:\n1. Love\n2. Acceptance\n3. Responsibility \n4. Awareness of being not body and mind\n\nEtc. But the point is, we tend to think shambhavi is just those 40 minutes or 80 minutes of exercise. I made this mistake for few months and got lost.\n\nBut now I have decided to stick with unwavering acceptance. \n\nAm I perfect? No. But isn\u2019t it just a game :) I want to win, but if I lose, then its okay.\n\nWith that spirit in mind, I am sticking to acceptance. But I want to help or bring more awareness on this point to many who are on this path. Especially isha meditators who honestly are like siblings in one way as we all are connected via our guru.\n\nSo I am thinking of creating a discord community so that some of us who really want to make our whole life a sadhana can talk with the each other, encourage each other and share experiences. I know in this path we are all alone but hey, sometimes who knows someone can help someone else in the community to get to their ultimate nature!\n\nI get that Sadhguru usually doesn\u2019t promote intra communities(or so I have observed) and he must have his valid reasons. Hence we can stick to just this one thing and help others if need be by our own experiences.\n\nIf anyone of you are interested then you can DM me or ping me. If I see more than 10 people interested then maybe I will create a discord server or something.\n\nNamaskaram!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Sadhguru/comments/18v51c4/thinking_of_starting_a_community_of_people/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "\"Extinct\" 1690s Peanut resurrected when researchers found 40 surviving nuts in North Carolina State University lab", "summary": "", "link": "https://nationalpeanutboard.org/news/a-1690s-peanut-is-reborn/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Eddie Vedder gifts guitars to young musicians for Christmas", "summary": "", "link": "https://consequence.net/2023/12/eddie-vedder-gifts-guitars-young-musicians-oahu/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "Manchester United\u2019s misery continues following dismal defeat to ...", "summary": "Manchester United\u2019s misery continues following dismal defeat to ...&nbsp;&nbsp;", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjMvMTIvMzEvc3BvcnQvbWFuY2hlc3Rlci11bml0ZWQtZGVmZWF0LW5vdHRpbmdoYW0tZm9yZXN0LXRlbi1oYWctc3B0LWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5", "published_js": "2023-12-31", "author": "None"}]}}};
