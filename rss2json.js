How would you describe or classify the type of problem-solving involved in Computer Vision? What kind of challenges or problems are you most often faced with in CV? What does a typical work-day as a Computer Vision Engineer look like? \n\n2. How much of your job in CV revolves around model design and implementation as opposed to Data Curation/Manipulation and fine-tuning of the results/model? Do you find this portion of the job to be interesting or satisfying?\n\n3. I know it\u2019s hard to say concretely, but how much experience or education in Computer Vision specifically do companies look for in Computer Vision interns or entry level employees? Is a single CV class possibly sufficient, or would one want to pursue more in-depth related areas like Machine Learning or other more in-depth theory classes?\n\n\n**Background:** I am a Mechanical Engineer who\u2019s currently pursuing an MS in Computer Science. The program is a little non-standard in that I have the ability to take a wide range of courses, rather than doing research or a specific focus. As such, I\u2019ve taken a wide range of CS classes geared towards a career in Software Engineering.\n\nOne area I\u2019m interested in is Computer Vision, however, I don\u2019t have many courses remaining in my degree and need to decide which courses to omit. I am currently in a Computer Vision course and could possibly take Intro to Machine Learning if I decide to go the CV path, but I would have to sacrifice some pretty important/interesting courses to do so.\n\nThe feedback I've often heard echoed from ML Engineers is that their job is less about designing and coding the systems/models, and rather the bulk majority of their time either curating or cleaning up data and fine-tuning the model parameters to get the desired results.
