I have some amazing news to share with you! I have created a new python library called **better_bing_image_downloader**.\n\n It is a powerful and convenient tool to download bulk images from Bing without any API keys. It is compatible with python 3.x and above and it is hosted on both pip and github.\n\n You can install it easily with pip install better-bing-image-downloader. \n\nThe README.md file on github gives you a comprehensive idea of how to use this package to its fullest potential in any project that requires web image scraping. \n\nYou can check it out here:  [Pypi Link]( or  [GitHub Repo]( .\n  \nI hope this library will be helpful for your data and machine learning projects. I would love to hear your feedback and suggestions!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1arx769/a_small_python_package_to_scrape_images_from_web/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Any RTS games written in python?", "summary": "Looking for an example similar to [Beyond All Reason]( but written in python.
