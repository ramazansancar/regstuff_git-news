The author, an automation expert, criticizes the lack of understanding and regulation of AI in vehicles, which has led to accidents and deaths. He also provides five insights based on his experience with the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, including the shift of human error from operation to coding and the unpredictability of AI failure modes.\n      Additionally, the author argues that AI systems, whether in cars or in language models, struggle to make decisions under uncertainty as they lack judgement. He also emphasizes the need for maintaining AI after it's created, as it is just as important as creating it. Finally, he warns that the risks associated with AI will increase with the rise of more complex systems, calling for regulation and industry standards to keep pace with technological advancements.\n  \n\n\n\n  Full article: What Self-Driving Cars Tell Us About AI Risks - IEEE Spectrum\n\n\n---\nPS: Emergent Mind is for sale.", "link": "https://www.emergentmind.com/posts/what-self-driving-cars-tell-us-about-ai-risks-ieee", "published_js": "2023-07-31", "author": "None"}, {"title": "AI search of Neanderthal proteins resurrects \u2018extinct\u2019 antibiotics", "summary": "Summary:\n  \n      Bioengineers applied artificial intelligence to data about proteins from extinct hominins, including Neanderthals and Denisovans, to identify molecules with bacteria-fighting capabilities.\n      These 'de-extinct' molecules could be used to develop new antibiotics, addressing the growing issue of antibiotic resistance.\n  \n\n\n\n  Full article: AI search of Neanderthal proteins resurrects \u2018extinct\u2019 antibiotics\n\n\n---\nPS: Emergent Mind is for sale.", "link": "https://www.emergentmind.com/posts/ai-search-of-neanderthal-proteins-resurrects-extinct", "published_js": "2023-07-31", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Artificial Intelligence as a Game-Changer for the Travel Industry.

Current technologies include the use of drones and satellite imagery for surveillance, identifying diseases early, and managing epidemics.
