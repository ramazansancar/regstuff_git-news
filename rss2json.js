Huang foresaw the importance of parallel computing for AI and made strategic decisions to distribute the company's software, CUDA, for free to researchers. This built an ecosystem around Nvidia's GPUs, optimizing their usage for AI computations. Furthermore, the company has become a leading player in the transformer models in AI, which are essential for large, scalable models.\n      Nvidia's importance to the AI industry has been affirmed by its trillion-dollar valuation and its indispensable role in the large language model revolution. The company is now a major supplier to both gaming and data center sectors.
