We successfully processed an initial image by converting it to black and white, highlighting key areas. However, Tesseract isn't compatible with this first image; it requires an image similar to a second type we have. Our objective is to eliminate the black background while preserving everything else, essentially transitioning from the first image type to the second. Our request to GPT-4 was framed as follows:\n\nWe possess an image in black and white. In this image, the text appears in black. Surrounding the text, there's a 5 cm white border (acting as a highlight). Beyond this highlighted area, the entire background is black. Our aim is to retain the text and the white areas around it, while transforming the rest of the background to white. \n\nHowever, the code it is giving  for this purpose isn't functioning correctly. Here's the code:\n\n \n\n`public static Bitmap RemplirArrierePlan3(Bitmap bitmap)`\n\n`{`\n\n`Mat binaryImage = bitmap.ToMat();`\n\n`if (binaryImage.NumberOfChannels &gt; 1)`\n\n`{`\n\n`CvInvoke.CvtColor(binaryImage, binaryImage, ColorConversion.Bgr2Gray);`\n\n`}`\n\n`CvInvoke.Threshold(binaryImage, binaryImage, 128, 255, ThresholdType.Binary);`\n\n`CvInvoke.Imwrite(\"C:\\\\resultat.png\", binaryImage);`\n\n`double tailleMinimale = 1;`\n\n`Mat labels = new Mat();`\n\n`Mat stats = new Mat();`\n\n`Mat centroids = new Mat();`\n\n`int nombreDeComposants = CvInvoke.ConnectedComponentsWithStats(binaryImage, labels, stats, centroids);`\n\n`for (int i = 1; i &lt; nombreDeComposants; i++)`\n\n`{`\n\n`int area = Marshal.ReadInt32(stats.DataPointer + stats.Step * i + 4 * sizeof(int));`\n\n`if (area &lt;= tailleMinimale)`\n\n`{`\n\n`Mat mask = new Mat();`\n\n[`CvInvoke.Compare`](https://cvinvoke.compare/)`(labels, new ScalarArray(new MCvScalar(i)), mask, CmpType.Equal);`\n\n`binaryImage.SetTo(new MCvScalar(255), mask);`\n\n`}`\n\n`}`\n\n`return binaryImage.ToBitmap();`\n\n`}`\n\nThanks a lot.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/19arzqc/question_how_can_i_eliminate_the_background_from/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "C++ middleware code generator", "summary": "The [front tier](https://github.com/Ebenezer-group/onwards/blob/master/src/tiers/front/genz.cc) of my code generator has a command line interface.

I'm unsure how to identify specific gestures in real-time.\n\nAlso, I'm focusing on 30 gestures just for this one!.\n\nI know this might sound a bit overwhelming, but I really need some guidance. Any advice, resources, or direction on how to tackle these issues, particularly with video preprocessing and gesture recognition in real-time, would be immensely appreciated!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/19asalb/urgent_help_needed_for_sign_language_recognition/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How does one become a mod for this sub?", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Sadhguru/comments/19aath3/how_does_one_become_a_mod_for_this_sub/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "10,000-year-old burials from an unknown hunter-gatherer group have been discovered at Sao Luis, Brazil", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/10000-year-old-burials-from-unknown-hunter-gatherer-group-discovered-in-brazil", "author": "None"}, {"title": "int8 model, how to rescale the predicted bounding boxes", "summary": "hello,\n\ni had a yolov8 model (.pt) which i wanted to convert to .onnx in int8\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nsince yolo's export function lacks support of onnx int8, i exported it to .tflite with int8 parameter, also using my data.yaml as parameter\n\nthen i had  a int8.tflite model in saved\\_model\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nusing tf2onnx.convert  i converted  .tflite to .onnx (int8)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthe problem during Inference is, the bounding boxes need to be rescaled, but i don't know how to find out those x\\_scale and y\\_scale parameters\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nfollowing code works for rescaling, but bounding boxes are not exactly same as the float model, \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ni manually made out those scaling factors below  (i.e. \\*= 2.65  or \\*= 3.25)  by training many different values, and seeing which seems best.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nmy question is. how can i find out those values?  i resize images to 320x320,  original frame size is 2880x1860, pls see following file to see preprocess and postprocess;\n\n[https://gist.github.com/hu8813/7699b346e02951dff871083cf6248232](https://gist.github.com/hu8813/7699b346e02951dff871083cf6248232)\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthe code i used for Inference:\n\n    import cv2\n    from prepare import YOLOv8\n    \n    model_path = \"./best_int8.onnx\"\n    image_path = \"./test.jpg\"\n    \n    frame = cv2.imread(image_path)\n    \n    detector = YOLOv8(model_path, conf_thres=0.05, iou_thres=0.1)\n    boxes, scores, class_ids = detector(frame)\n    \n    for box, score, class_id in zip(boxes, scores, class_ids):\n        x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max = box\n    \n        x_min *= 2.65\n        y_min *= 310\n        x_max *= 3.25\n        y_max *= 330\n        width = (x_max -
