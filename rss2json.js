I have a pretty good start on my statement of purpose, but would love to hear from someone who has been through the program and has a better feel for the non-classwork aspects of the program (e.g. internship/networking opportunities, research opportunities, general campus amenities). Would also love to know how common it is for students to work in Sweden after graduation.\n\nFor some background: I have a basic foundation in general and statistical programming skills, and my undergrad degree was in linguistics. For my linguistics studies, I specialized in semantics, albeit from a more theoretical perspective (metaphysics of language, misinformation, truth, etc). While I often applied programming skills to research projects I did in linguistics classes, I never had enough time in my schedule to take specific computational linguistics classes, so I'm excited to have the chance to study it now. My interests are predominantly in information management/information retrieval, and how NLP (and AI) can be applied in museum, library, and archival contexts - really any line of work that deals with curation. Am also interested in exploring how fact-checking tools work.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/18x5rar/masters_in_language_technology_at_gothenburg/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "My Recent Sadhana Experiences", "summary": "Namaskaram, I completed IE about almost 5 years ago now, and since then I've taken Surya Kriya, Yogasanas, Shoonya, BSP and Samyama (about 8 ish months ago). I've always been consistent with my Sadhana and I never rushed into taking the next program. I waited about a full year after doing IE to take Surya Kriya, and a year after that I took Yogasanas, and the following year - Shoonya. In that sense I gave myself lots of time to be able to fully integrate the practice into my life.\n\nIt's been a fantastic 5 years I should say, and these have definitely been the most profound and intense years of my life, without a shadow of a doubt - this I can say without hesitation. Sadhana has always been my lifeline whenever life would become challenging. I can't think of the number of times that Sadhana has been at my rescue!\n\nI have been able to successfully maintain doing all my practices everyday - Surya Kriya X 1, Yogasanas, SCK twice, Shoonya twice, Shambhavi, and Samyama. What I'm seeing these days is that every single wrong decision I make comes back to haunt me ten times worse/bad. Also, sometimes I feel like even the smallest of frustration gets to me. Like someone might make a comment, and instead of letting it go, I find myself reacting to it and thinking about it for hours. And then this itself makes me judge myself and feel even worse.\n\nI'm starting to see just how compulsive I am and how many limitations I have. Before I used to have this image of myself being able to drop everything, but from what I see now, it's far far away. I guess my question is....is there anyone out there who is also experiencing the \"lows\" and being \"down in the dumps\" after maintaining Sadhana for a long period of time?
