I look at the stuff on this forum and I am a bit scared that I\u2019m jumping into something that is way above my abilities. I have a BS in mechanical engineering, and I have 2 years of experience. When it comes to programming, I took some courses in undergrad, and I\u2019m a high level beginner at best in Python. I can use pandas and NumPy, but I don\u2019t know any computer architecture, algorithms, version control, or any of that software engineering stuff. I\u2019ve done some machine learning, but it was mostly following scikit-learn tutorials. No PyTorch or TensorFlow, which from my time on this forum, seems important. \n\nI want to aim high and work as an ML/CV Engineer after getting my grad degree. I know I need to improve my programming skills not just to be able to get through my graduate courses, but also for when I\u2019m applying for internships/getting a job. I am determined to go down this path. \n\nI have 8 months until my graduate program starts. What would you recommend I do to get caught up? I have referenced r/learnprogramming, but I want to know if you guys might have specific recommendations on what to learn and what actual ML/CV Engineers in industry use on a daily basis. I work a full time job, so I would have around 5-10 hours per week to grind out material. Should I just do a bunch of leetcode? Do I need to speedrun an undergrad curriculum in 8 months? Maybe it is enough to do the deeplearning.ai courses on Machine Learning and Big Data?\n\nThank you so much in advance.

At work, I often have to use Qdrant DB and, unfortunately, the helm chart has its limitations. For myself and other Qdrant users, I began developing an operator for Kubernetes that allows me to manage various Qdrant clusters and Vector collections. I would be glad to receive any feedbacks, github issues and advices.  \n\n\nAnd here is the operator with a quickstart guide and yaml examples: [https://github.com/ganochenkodg/qdrant-operator](https://github.com/ganochenkodg/qdrant-operator)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/qdrant/comments/190f6zc/qdrant_operator_for_kubernetes/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "I have a growing community of users, but struggling to find more contributors.", "summary": "Hi Opensource!\n\nI'm the co-creator of F3D, an opensource C++, fast and minimalist 3D viewer: https://f3d.app.\n\nFor the last two years, we (the maintainers) have been pushing F3D hard.\nTons of contributions, regular releases, creation of a discord community, following github standards, improving communication on different platform, thinking about SEO.\n\nWe had a few small viral success on reddit, youtube and even hacker news.\n\nAs a result, the number  of users seems to be growing steadly and we are verry happy about it!\n\nHowever, our users are not programmers and the number of contributors does not grow at all.\n\nI've been trying to improve the situation by creating dev oriented documentation, especially targeted to beginners, and creating dedicated tags in our issues. But not much success so far.\n\nDo you have any ideas how to improve that situation ? I just want people to take an interest in the project, try it out and start helping wherever they can. We are trying to help as much as we can on discord but it has not proven very successful.\n\nFeel free to share your thoughts on what we have been missing, and if the projet looks like something you may be interested by, feel free to join!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/190n4fr/i_have_a_growing_community_of_users_but/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "NYC is more ethnically diverse, less racially segregated, report finds", "summary": "", "link": "https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-is-more-ethnically-diverse-less-racially-segregated-report-finds", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Old kingdom tomb discovered in Egypt", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.archaeology.org/news/12034-230105-egypt-saqqara-tomb", "author": "None"}, {"title": "What is the best sort of yogic discipline to be done everyday?", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Sadhguru/comments/190hmvl/what_is_the_best_sort_of_yogic_discipline_to_be/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Seeking feedback on a synthetic data tooling project", "summary": "At work I've been developing object detectors for some pretty niche uses cases and I have been struggling to find representative data.
