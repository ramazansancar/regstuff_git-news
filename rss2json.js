This makes the discovery one of the oldest celestial maps found in Italy.\n\nThe researchers meticulously identified 29 engravings on the stone, corresponding precisely to ancient constellations such as Scorpius, Orion, the Pleiades, and Cassiopeia. Analysis of the stone's cut marks suggests that these carvings were likely crafted by an individual using rudimentary tools - a hammer and a basic metal chisel with a 6-7 mm tip.\n\nOf particular intrigue is the 29th engraving, which diverges from established celestial models. Researchers propose that it may depict a supernova, a transient celestial event that briefly illuminated the ancient night sky before vanishing.\n\nTo further investigate this hypothesis, scientists suggest that tracing the focal point in the night sky through the 29th engraving may unveil a black hole left behind by the supernova explosion. This groundbreaking discovery sheds new light on ancient astronomical observations at Castelliere di Rupinpiccolo, offering a glimpse into the celestial wonders that captivated ancient inhabitants more than two millennia ago.\n\nImage credit: INAF", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/18qtulz", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Made these bots to cheat at online bingo on iOS", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/AdmTal/bingo-bots", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Iceland\u2019s \u2018bike whisperer\u2019: the vigilante who finds stolen bicycles \u2013 and helps thieves change", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2023/dec/25/bicycle-jesus-vigilante-who-finds-stolen-bikes-bjartmar-leosson-reykjavik", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Lifesaving Malaria Vaccine Set To Save Hundreds Of Thousands Of Children", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/new-low-cost-malaria-vaccine-could-save-millions-by-peter-singer-2023-12", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The Nightmare on Christmas Eve", "summary": "", "link": "/r/livesound/comments/18qbrrt/the_nightmare_on_christmas_eve/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "snowboard: fast, simple &amp; reliable http rust servers \ud83e\udd80\ud83c\udfc2", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/Brian3647/snowboard", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Sushanti Meditation", "summary": "I did yogasanas a while back but didnt keep up the practice now I am trying to give it a go again.
