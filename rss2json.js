This issue of hallucination is arguably the biggest hindrance to safely deploying these powerful LLMs into real-world production systems that impact people's lives. The journey toward widespread adoption of LLMs in practical settings heavily relies on addressing and mitigating hallucinations. Unlike traditional AI systems focused on limited tasks, LLMs have been exposed to vast amounts of online text data during training. While this allows them to display impressive language fluency, it also means they are capable of extrapolating information from the biases in training data, misinterpreting ambiguous prompts, or modifying the information to align superficially with the input. This becomes hugely alarming when we rely on language generation capabilities for sensitive applications, such as summarizing medical records, financial analysis reports, etc. **This paper presents a comprehensive survey of over 32 techniques developed to mitigate hallucination in LLMs.** Notable among these are Retrieval Augmented Generation (Lewis et al, 2021), Knowledge Retrieval (Varshney et al,2023), CoNLI (Lei et al, 2023), and CoVe (Dhuliawala et al, 2023). Furthermore, we introduce a detailed taxonomy categorizing these methods based on various parameters, such as dataset utilization, common tasks, feedback mechanisms, and retriever types. This classification helps distinguish the diverse approaches specifically designed to tackle hallucination issues in LLMs. Additionally, we analyze the challenges and limitations inherent in these techniques, providing a solid foundation for future research in addressing hallucinations and related phenomena within the realm of LLMs.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1ayr4vh/a_comprehensive_survey_of_hallucination/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Android 4.1.1 mini tablet", "summary": "So I found a mini tablet from 2014 with android 4.1.1 so what should I do with it also I won't connect it with the internet so the apps won't update", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/androidafterlife/comments/1ayx8e4/android_411_mini_tablet/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A follow-up to \"Open-sourcing my Internet OS with 1 million users\"", "summary": "Hi all,\n\nLast week [I posted in this very subreddit]( about my intention to open-source [my \"Internet OS\"]( and I was truly shocked by the support I received from this amazing community.

I was testing the camera function on my S23 and was looking at the hyperlapse and noticed the fastest hyperlapse is 60x in daytime and 300x for star tracking and it does it by taking long exposures. I was wondering if it was possible to record a hyperlapse of 300x in daytime as a setting, which led me to thinking about if flashing my Note 9 with a custom ROM/OS (Not sure what the correct term would be) would allow me to do things like this and others, now that I don't need to worry at all about bricking the phone.\n\nI'm generally after just any ways to get a much wider array of functionality out of it, any ideas are welcome, it's more of a fun project than a serious need for something so anything is welcome.\n\nThanks in advance.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/androidafterlife/comments/1aysazt/repurpose_galaxy_note_9_with_different_romos_for/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Wearing linga bhairavi pendant", "summary": "So I have been wearing it for a few months now.
