So I wanted to share it with the world. Oh, and it's FOSS of course.\n\nIt's intended to be used either as a cross-platform desktop app (built using wails) or to be run in a Docker container, for homelab uses, etc.\n\nPRs and feature requests are more than welcome :-)\n\nRight now, I could also use some help for distributing it across the different platforms, AUR, Flatpak, etc.\n\nI hope you guys like it.
