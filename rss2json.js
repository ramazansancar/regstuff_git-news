Found beneath a quarry, the structure is circular and shares similarities with Stonehenge. Burned stones were found at the center, hinting at either cremations or a sauna. I\u2019m team sauna, but maybe that\u2019s just because it\u2019s cold and I could go for a steam. The site also revealed a mammoth tusk and a greenstone axe dating back 4,000 to 5,000 years.\n* [China's Medieval Tang Dynasty Had a Surprising Level of Social Mobility, New Study Finds]( \u2014 A study analyzing tomb epitaphs from the Tang Dynasty (618\u2013907 CE) in medieval China revealed significant social mobility driven by education. Epitaphs of the period were highly detailed accounts of life using both prose and poems, and these epitaphs indicated that passing the Keju (the Imperial Exam) was crucial for career success, overriding family status post-650 CE. This reflects a shift from aristocracy to meritocracy, paralleling contemporary social mobility patterns influenced by education.\n* [1,700-Year-Old Metal Object \u2014 \u2018One of Archaeology\u2019s Great Enigmas\u2019 \u2014 Unearthed in UK]( \u2014 Amateur archaeologists in Eastern England unearthed a rare 1,700-year-old copper alloy Gallo-Roman dodecahedron. I\u2019ve covered newly discovered dodecahedrons before, and as was the case, then, the purpose of the 12-sided object remains a mystery, with no Roman literature describing such artifacts. Experts\u2019 best guess is that they were used for religious or ritual practices, but take that with a grain of salt because that\u2019s what we assume about every object that we don\u2019t understand. It's made of copper, tin, and an unusually high amount of lead (18%) of lead, making it fragile. It was intentionally placed in a pit alongside some pottery. This find is the 33rd dodecahedron discovered in Roman Britain, but the first in the Midlands region.\n* [Hunter-Gatherers Were Mostly Gatherers, Says Archaeologist]( \u2014 Archaeological evidence from burial sites in the Peruvian Andes dating to between 9,000 and 6,500 years ago suggests early hunter-gatherers' diets were primarily plant-based. According to Randy Haas, \u201c*Conventional wisdom holds that early human economies focused on hunting \u2013 an idea that has led to a number of high-protein dietary fads such as the paleo diet. Our analysis shows that the diets were composed of 80% plant matter and 20% meat.*\u201d There was a particular reliance on wild potatoes and root vegetables.\n* [Engraving on 2,000-Year-Old Knife Thought to Be Oldest Runes in Denmark]( \u2014 Archaeologists in Denmark have discovered a 2,000-year-old knife with an engraving believed to be one of the oldest runic inscription in the country (along with a bone comb found nearby in 1865). The 8 cm iron knife, found in a grave on Funen island, has an inscription spelling out \"hirila,\" meaning \"little sword\" in Old Norse. This discovery predates the Jelling stones by 800 years and offers insights into early Scandinavian language and culture.\n\nHope you enjoyed this abridged version of [Ancient Beat]( Have a great weekend!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1acaa2d/this_weeks_archaeological_news_woodhenges/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Is there a way to reverse-mask the output images of Yolov8 from object detection?", "summary": "I have a project that aims to detect safe landing zones of drones utilizing the YOLOv8 model for object detection.

Each patient have an id which is a column in the csv and also the name of the corresponds image of the patient. We have two classes - \"0\" and \"1\" which represent \"non skin disease\" and \"skin disease\" respectively.  \n\n\nNow in addition to the columns mentioned (patient id and class), we also have more 3 columns: \"patientAge\", \"patientSex\", and \"ViewPosition\" which indicates from which position the image was taken.\n\nSo if I'm understanding the workflow in image classification specifically, and lets narrow down to pytorch for make it more simple -  \n1. first we split the data to training / validation / test sets\n\n2. we create a custom dataset that will preprocess the data, maybe some augmentations, some transforms like normalization and ToTensor and return the image as tensor of pixels with the associated label as a tensor.\n\n3. create a model class, maybe custom model architecture we will build ourselves or a class that implement a way to load specified pre-trained models and control the fine tune depth.\n\n4. creating a class for the training and evaluation process which might contain the creation of dataloaders, training loop, loss function, metrics calculation, etc.\n\n5. inference (predicting on test images).\n\nNow this is a very general work flow in image classification, I know, but even if I go into details I can't think of how I incorporate the other patient age/sex and view position columns.\n\nThe only way I can think of is for maybe 3 things:\n\n1. Data splitting while considering the distribution not only of the classes but the mentioned 3 columns\n2.
