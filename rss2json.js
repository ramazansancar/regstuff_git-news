I've come to reddit to ask a few questions about your experiences on vibrations of the body. Last Night I had a Pretty strange Experience during my session that really stood out to me.

As I was Watching the breathe become slower and less. I began to feel my Heartbeat On my Forehead. I was Truly Amazed but I kept My focus I didn't let it shake me from this state I was in. After Chanting AUM(before Transitioning to Shambavi Mudra) I noticed it left an imprint like sensation in the navel(A), spot where the rib cage meets(U), and the throat(M).(As state by Sadhguru where you would feel it) As I slightly focused in the Areas I noticed my Heart Beat Travel from My Forehead to my navel, From my navel to Below the rib cage, Finally From below the rib Cage to the pit of my Throat. With Each beat it felt like the centers would vibrate has if I was verbally Chanting Aum. For a While I was Slowly And carefully Focusing my Attention From One center to the other.
