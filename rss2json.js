This approach aimed to motivate 3D artists/teams, ensuring they receive payment in milestones as they create synthetic image datasets tailored to the requirements.\n\nHowever, feedback from some members of the computer vision community suggests that crowdfunding individual datasets might be impractical. One person pointed out that identifying individuals who meet all the criteria below could be challenging:\n\nNeed a specific synthetic image dataset.\nWilling to complete a Google form expressing interest.\nReady to pledge and pay for agreed-upon milestones via Paystack (as Kickstarter and GoFundMe are not available in my country, Ghana).\nConsidering this input, I seek your advice:\n\nA. Continue to pursue backers for individual datasets, regardless of the potential challenges.\n\nB. Opt for crowdfunding the creation of the entire online marketplace.\n\nC. If none of the above, please suggest one or more alternatives you believe would be more effective.\n\nThank you\n\n#syntheticdata #syntheticdatageneration #syntheticimage #techfounder #africantech founder", "link": "https://i.redd.it/fbc1vpzrx7ic1.jpeg", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "\u2018Incredible\u2019 Kelvin Kiptum was targeting more marathon history before his death aged 24", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">\u2018Incredible\u2019 Kelvin Kiptum was targeting more marathon history before his death aged 24</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDIvMTMvc3BvcnQva2VsdmluLWtpcHR1bS1tYXJhdGhvbi1yZWNvcmQtZGVhdGgtc3B0LWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBYGh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjQvMDIvMTMvc3BvcnQva2VsdmluLWtpcHR1bS1tYXJhdGhvbi1yZWNvcmQtZGVhdGgtc3B0LWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-02-13", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Chiefs beat 49ers in thrilling Super Bowl LVIII: Live updates", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Chiefs beat 49ers in thrilling Super Bowl LVIII: Live updates</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tL3Nwb3J0L2xpdmUtbmV3cy9zdXBlci1ib3dsLWNoaWVmcy00OWVycy0wMi0xMS0yNC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFTaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vc3BvcnQvbGl2ZS1uZXdzL3N1cGVyLWJvd2wtY2hpZWZzLTQ5ZXJzLTAyLTExLTI0L2luZGV4Lmh0bWw?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-02-12", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Nick Taylor wins raucous WM Phoenix Open in playoff after crowd trouble bedevils tournament", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Nick Taylor wins raucous WM Phoenix Open in playoff after crowd trouble bedevils tournament</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDIvMTIvc3BvcnQvbmljay10YXlsb3ItcGhvZW5peC1vcGVuLWNyb3dkLXRyb3VibGUtc3B0LWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBY2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjQvMDIvMTIvc3BvcnQvbmljay10YXlsb3ItcGhvZW5peC1vcGVuLWNyb3dkLXRyb3VibGUtc3B0LWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-02-12", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Chinese teenager breaks 100m freestyle world record at World Championships", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Chinese teenager breaks 100m freestyle world record at World Championships</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDIvMTIvc3BvcnQvY2hpbmEtc3dpbW1pbmctd29ybGQtcmVjb3JkLXBhbi16aGFubGUtaW50bC1obmstc3B0L2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAWdodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDI0LzAyLzEyL3Nwb3J0L2NoaW5hLXN3aW1taW5nLXdvcmxkLXJlY29yZC1wYW4temhhbmxlLWludGwtaG5rLXNwdC9pbmRleC5odG1s?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-02-12", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 Mecole Hardman tells CNN he \u2018blacked out\u2019 after scoring the Super Bowl-winning touchdown", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Kansas City Chiefs\u2019 Mecole Hardman tells CNN he \u2018blacked out\u2019 after scoring the Super Bowl-winning touchdown</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDIvMTIvc3BvcnQva2Fuc2FzLWNpdHktY2hpZWZzLW1lY29sZS1oYXJkbWFuLXRvdWNoZG93bi1zcHQtaW50bC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFoaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyNC8wMi8xMi9zcG9ydC9rYW5zYXMtY2l0eS1jaGllZnMtbWVjb2xlLWhhcmRtYW4tdG91Y2hkb3duLXNwdC1pbnRsL2luZGV4Lmh0bWw?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-02-12", "author": "None"}]}}};
