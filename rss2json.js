A Unified Framework for Efficient Visual 3D Perception", "summary": "Autonomous Driving systems rely heavily on accurate 3D scene understanding to plan and navigate safely. Progress has been made in recent years in visual 3D detection via feature transformation, temporal fusion, and supervision signal design. However, detection focuses on objects and struggles with representing complete spatial occupancy. Meanwhile, occupancy prediction methods can represent geometry and semantics more comprehensively but less efficiently. Exploring the interplay between detection and occupancy prediction could lead to unified, efficient 3D perception. But ensuring shared representation and architecture has proven challenging.\n\n  \nToday we want to highlight a 2024 paper \"UniVision\" that proposes an elegantly simple and efficient unified vision-centric framework for 3D perception, jointly tackling detection and occupancy tasks. A key contribution is an explicit-implicit view transform module combining depth-guided lifting and query-guided sampling to simplify 2D-3D feature transformation. It proposes a specialized module for extracting, enhancing, and fusing localized voxel features and global BEV representations adaptively. Training stability and efficiency are improved through joint occupancy-detection data augmentation and progressive loss weighting. Experiments across four benchmarks including nuScenes LiDAR segmentation, nuScenes detection, OpenOccupancy, and Occ3D demonstrate UniVision achieves state-of-the-art performance. [\n\n[UniVision: A Unified Framework for Vision-Centric 3D Perception](\n\nThis unified design significantly improves model generalization and enables vision-based systems to handle complex driving scenes previously challenging for camera-only systems. By extending the multi-task capabilities, UniVision paves the road for vision systems to perform various critical functionalities end-to-end. UniVision represents convincing strides towards accurate and efficient 3D scene comprehension from more readily available visual data.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1b6uzrt/sota2_a_unified_framework_for_efficient_visual_3d/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Archaeologists find missing top half of Ramses II statue in Egypt", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.thenationalnews.com/mena/egypt/2024/03/05/archaeologists-find-missing-top-half-of-ramses-ii-statue-in-egypt/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Make starship color different for other Kubernetes cluster", "summary": "When I switch from one Kubernetes cluster to the next, like here via export, then the name changes.
