Given that almost everybody uses Google's productivity tools like Drive, Gmail, Docs, sheets, slides etc... why isn't there an open-source project that is similar to this. I've been pondering about starting an open-source project related to this. Basically, an open-source alternative to Google's most frequently used tools. I know there are other independent alternatives for specific usecases, but integrating them with each other is a nightmare. The primary focus would be privacy (we all know what Google does with our data), easy integration among the different tools. While also allowing the tools to be modular. That is to say, if somebody wants to use just the Google docs-like tool of ours and not the Google drive-like tool they can easily do so. Also making each tool as lightweight as possible, without any of the tracking things and other crapware. The end goal is to allow people to be able to self host them on their server/computer so they can totally do away with Google. Questions: 1. Do you think this going to be a project that'll gain traction or will it just get abandoned because of the mammoth size of the project? 2. Would you be interested to contribute to a project like this?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/198wxgm/opensource_alternative_to_googles_suite_of_tools/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ollama Shell Helper (osh) : English to Unix-like Shell Commands translation using Local LLMs with Ollama", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/charyan/osh", "author": "None"}, {"title": "ksimple - k language interpreter for learning purposes", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/kparc/ksimple", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Leantime 3.0 Released!
