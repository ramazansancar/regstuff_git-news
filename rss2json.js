Here is Indian Time Zone's version:\n\nBy this time, Sage Agastya had traveled to the Kodagu mountains (in Coorg). Lord Ganesha then took the appearance of a crow and landed on the edge of the kamandalu, while Agastya Muni was involved in meditation. The sage then realized this and raised his hands to remove the crow. But while departing, the divine crow tipped and knocked over the sacred pot. Thus River Kaveri was poured on the ground and she started to flow in to the land, which is now known as Talakaveri (Talacauvery).\nThe divine crow then took the appearance of a small boy. The holy sage realized that the small boy was playing some trick. Agastya Muni clenched his fists and tried to strike on the head of the boy. The small boy then ran away and the sage followed him. Eventually the boy took the form of Lord Ganesha and appeared in front of Agastya. The sage became astounded to discover that the boy was Ganesha. As penance, Agastya Muni started hit his own head with his clenched fists. The Lord then stopped him and blessed the sage with wisdom.\n\nI'm interested in knowing where this story comes from- is it retold in any scripture? Is it at least referenced to in a scripture? If it's not, and it's simply a folktale, what is its origin and significance?", "link": "https://hinduism.stackexchange.com/questions/55599/where-does-the-story-of-ganesha-taking-the-form-of-a-crow-come-from", "published_js": "2023-06-27", "author": "CDR"}, {"title": "Are there multiple versions of how Ganesa got an elephant head?", "summary": "In addition to the main version (Siva cutting off his head)\nBard AI says\n\nAnother story says that Ganesha was born with an elephant head.

The elephant is a symbol of wisdom in many cultures, and its strength is evident in its large size and powerful trunk.\n\n.........................\n\nIn another version, Ganesha's head was cut off by a demon named Jambavan. Jambavan was a powerful demon who was trying to steal Parvati's jewels. Ganesha stood in his way, and Jambavan cut off his head. When Parvati saw what had happened, she was furious. She cursed Jambavan, and he was turned into a monkey. Parvati then asked Vishnu to find the head of the first animal he saw. Vishnu found the head of a white elephant, and he brought it back to Parvati.

While I can sometimes power through, generally this mix of being very visible, dancing and partaking in activities I don't know, understand or generally enjoy, is extremely uncomfortable for me. I can quite enjoy sitting on the side and watching people partake, jump, dance and partake in those types of activities; it is genuinelly fun for me; and in the past whenever I attempted to take part I was absolutely miserable, very quickly drained and, honestly, few times drove to tears as a result (it's that serious level of dread for me).\nSo I tend to just stand on the side, have a bit of chat with whomever is around and enjoy the sidelines. Generally people understand when I politely, but firmly, refuse to join with a warm smile and wishes of best of fun.\nSadly at last wedding the groom deiced not to, and it very quickly went from asking to join, to him trying to forcefully drag my arm, and resulting in a bit of wrestling for good 10-15 seconds, and almost came down to blows, until with help of the master o ceremonies he relized that maybe it's best to let go of me.\nStill, with this being so very public, and making me look like the right muppet who refuses to have fun and wrestles the groom on his wedding day... Enough to say I almost right after gathered my things and left the party after letting my wife know what has happened. It wasn't a big surprise, we had similar incident on the last wedding on her side of family.\nMy question is what could I have done better to get the message across?\nI am at wits end in all honesty, I tried to join those activities in the past and I was utterly miserable, just not my thing. After this incident I honestly considered just getting a shirt with &quot;I am autistic, leave me alone if I want to be left alone&quot; to wear to those occasions but that jars me because, well, why should I announce my issues just because someone cannot respect basic concept of &quot;no&quot; and personal space and integrity?\nSo help me please, how to handle it better in the future? Or should I just avoid those family weddings in the future, as so far that's the best solution I can come up with, as clearly behaviour like from the groom is normal and expected there if you refuse to actively participate.", "link": "https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/28345/how-to-handle-someone-insistence-to-join-in-party-activities-when-i-do-not-feel", "published_js": "2023-06-27", "author": "Tymoteusz Paul"}]}}};
