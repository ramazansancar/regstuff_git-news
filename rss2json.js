I'm assuming we need that to be able to get the trajectory of the ball, or do we not need that at all to be able to plot the trajectory.

A Complete Survey on Text-to-Video Generation", "summary": "**Paper**: [\n\n**Abstract**:\n\n&gt;Text-to-video generation marks a significant frontier in the rapidly  evolving domain of generative AI, integrating advancements in  text-to-image synthesis, video captioning, and text-guided editing. This  survey critically examines the progression of text-to-video  technologies, focusing on the shift from traditional generative models  to the cutting-edge Sora model, highlighting developments in scalability  and generalizability. Distinguishing our analysis from prior works, we  offer an in-depth exploration of the technological frameworks and  evolutionary pathways of these models. Additionally, we delve into  practical applications and address ethical and technological challenges  such as the inability to perform multiple entity handling, comprehend  causal-effect learning, understand physical interaction, perceive object  scaling and proportioning, and combat object hallucination which is  also a long-standing problem in generative models. Our comprehensive  discussion covers the topic of enablement of text-to-video generation  models as human-assistive tools and world models, as well as eliciting  model's shortcomings and summarizing future improvement direction that  mainly centers around training datasets and evaluation metrics (both  automatic and human-centered). Aimed at both newcomers and seasoned  researchers, this survey seeks to catalyze further innovation and  discussion in the growing field of text-to-video generation, paving the  way for more reliable and practical generative artificial intelligence  technologies.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1bfaonc/sora_as_an_agi_world_model_a_complete_survey_on/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Learning some POSIX shell", "summary": "I usually just do simple shell scripts in bash, I've read **POSIX** shells like dash are faster and I can live without \"bashisms\".
