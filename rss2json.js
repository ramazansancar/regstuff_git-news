For example, people write what they think is good or bad about two sides of a topic and they are mixed into a collection (digital or physical). For each one out of context, ask people to list pros and cons, and examples. Add those to the collection.\nThe final stage is when people take turns pegging anything they draw from the collection on a board with a spectrum \u201cgood or bad\u201d. It could help people acknowledge the bias they have for a particular topic, and consider that outside of that context, some cited principle or reason may actually have a different association to them, helping them realize the polarization they had, with which they approached a given topic.\nAny exercises or techniques or theories or related anecdotes on this, for group moderation or interpersonal facilitation?", "link": "https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/28340/decreasing-polarization-tendencies-in-a-group", "published_js": "2023-06-20", "author": "hmltn"}]}}};
