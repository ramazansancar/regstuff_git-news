It's not clear yet which accounts we have access to without having to ask this person for help. Pastor is not tech savvy at all so some replies have been slow about me getting account access and trying to help them out here. \n\nThe previous attendee that did the sermon recordings left under somewhat bad terms. The pastor thought that he would be willing to help us with the accounts but I'm not sure. I'm also not sure if there's anything he could spitefully do to hurt our accounts... Partially due to not knowing what all he had access to and all. \n\nAlso have concern about if I can logout of the iCloud account the iPad is signed in to and if doing so won't make the iPad unusable for future iCloud accounts and whatever... And even if I can logout of the iPad without the password (or reset it without password without dealing with iPad being iCloud locked)... The iPad belongs to the church, genuinely, so it's not an issue of ownership. Just the iCloud account. \n\nAs far as I know, the process previously was to record the sermons via the iPad on a tripod... Then upload to YouTube, then post the link from our Facebook account. \n\nLong-term I'm concerned about storage since I imagine even church YouTube accounts have a 15gb storage size limit. I figure I can make several copies of the sermons via other mediums like burned discs, maybe pay for slow transfer online bulk data storage, etc...  \n\nI plan to have a printout of user login details that the elders and pastor should have access to so that this doesn't happen again - where someone leaves or cant help anymore, and there's no recordings or uploads until that's resolved... You know, just have \"best practice\" procedures in place...\n\nAlso wondering if anyone happens to have a free or very cheap app suggestion for trimming the sermon videos. It took me a lot longer than it should have to trim down the sermon video via the native iOS built in video editor. It was really hard to drag the beginning and end of video trim slider bars to the specific spot they needed to be in in order to trim out the bad or unnecessary parts of the video. \n\nI know I can upload the video raw and download it to a PC to edit... Maybe there's a freeware windows program that can edit videos fast, but the one I've used takes hours to load the video before it can be clipped. It is called something like \"free video cutter\", quite literally... \n\nI also want to stress that we are a still relatively new church and budget probably isn't going to be allocated for much of this, so free is nice if possible for any software suggestions ...\n\nAny advice on what to do from here or any suggestions on improving the process? \n\n\nTl;dr \nHave a church owned iPad that we don't have the iCloud password to due to previous member leaving on bad terms. Unclear if he will help us, so I'm trying to go the route of figuring this out without contacting him as much as possible. \n\nWondering if we can sign out from the iPad without iCloud password and not have issues using a different iCloud account with it. \n\nCurrent process for recording and uploading sermon will likely be: record via iPad on a tripod --&gt; trim the video somehow (need better suggestions than built in iPad photo editor for trimming videos --- iPad free program or a good windows one) --&gt; upload video to YouTube --&gt; post link to sermon via Facebook.\n\nGoing forward, I want to make sure that the pastor and maybe the elders have account access so that we don't get locked out again if someone leaves or something happens to someone that managed this stuff...\n\nAny suggestions for how to do any of this better?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/churchtech/comments/1989zb3/taking_over_with_tech_but_dont_have_access/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Rare 2,550-year-old silver coin from Persian era uncovered in J'lem area", "summary": "", "link": "https://jpost.com/archaeology/article-782504", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Scalable Pre-training of Large Autoregressive Image Models", "summary": "**Paper**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08541](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08541) \n\n**Code and Models**: [https://github.com/apple/ml-aim](https://github.com/apple/ml-aim) \n\n**Models**: [https://huggingface.co/apple/AIM](https://huggingface.co/apple/aim) \n\n**Abstract**:   \n\n&gt;This paper introduces **AIM**, a collection of vision  models pre-trained  with an autoregressive objective. These models are  inspired by their  textual counterparts, i.e., Large Language Models  (LLMs), and exhibit  similar scaling properties.  Specifically, we highlight two key findings:  (1) the performance of the  visual features scale with both the model  capacity and the quantity of  data, (2) the value of the objective  function correlates with the  performance of the model on downstream  tasks. We illustrate the  practical implication of these findings by  pre-training a 7 billion  parameter AIM on 2 billion images, that  achieves 84.0% on ImageNet-1k  with a frozen trunk. Interestingly, even  at this scale, we observe no  sign of saturation in performance,  suggesting that AIM potentially  represents a new frontier for training  large-scale vision models. The  pre-training of AIM is similar to the  pre-training of LLMs, and does  not require any image-specific strategy  to stabilize the training at  scale.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/198wjft/scalable_pretraining_of_large_autoregressive/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How to check for data drift in computer vision models like liveliness detection or ocr models?", "summary": "Please suggest some techniques or methods", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/198sir6/how_to_check_for_data_drift_in_computer_vision/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Jailer 15.5 released: Database Subsetting and Relational Data Browsing Tool.", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/Wisser/Jailer", "author": "None"}, {"title": "sptui: a Spotify TUI player, written in Go and leveraging the charmbracelet/bubbletea library.", "summary": "", "link": "https://v.redd.it/z3hio0i7dtcc1", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Is rudraksha Diksha open for people already wearing Rudrakasha ?", "summary": "I am already wearing a Rudrakasha around my neck with a copper chain.
