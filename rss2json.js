There is a famous verse in the Upanishad that as a caterpillar reaches the end of a blade of grass, it curls and collects its body and then jumps to the next blade. Similarly, souls also collect their tendencies (samskaras) and go to the next life.\nIt is something like we start where we left off in the last life. For example, suppose a guy was a pious person in his previous life, in this life, he will be born into a family of devotees, where the environment will be conducive for him to study shastras and rekindle his innate tendencies.\nHowever, we frequently see in our societies that persons who are very successful and well-placed are doing terribly bad karma. Gurus say that this person is successful because he did good karma in his previous life. In this life, he is doing terrible things because of his free will, and he will get the fruits of this bad karma in the next life.\nNow, the question is if the person really did good karma in the previous birth, then his samskaras should compel him to do good in this life also. A pious person in the last life should do pious things in this life also due to his samskaras. If you say it is free will, then you have to admit free will is stronger than sanskaras. If samskaras are weak, then the theory of karma will break down.
