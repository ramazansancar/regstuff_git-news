The front end can still fetch data and everything since the API is public however the code for backend is only available after purchase.\n\nI understand that it\u2019s not completely open source it\u2019s more leaning towards open core but then what is open source? I can not completely open source the whole project and give a SAAS  solution since majority of the customers are interested in running the project themselves and want to make some changes in the software according to their needs.\n\nRegarding some way to monetise and pay bills for costs, this model is working fine, also it validates our companies software development abilities to clients for different projects for our main company. However I still question the narrative that we are building and question myself multiple times if this is the right approach.\n\nFor context here is the link to the repo: [\n\nLooking forward to all your suggestions and feedback.\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1b2lwwa/i_need_some_suggestions_regarding_my_open_source/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "\u2018We\u2019re coming:\u2019 Erling Haaland scores five goals in single game to send ominous message to rivals", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">\u2018We\u2019re coming:\u2019 Erling Haaland scores five goals in single game to send ominous message to rivals</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDIvMjgvc3BvcnQvZXJsaW5nLWhhYWxhbmQtbWFuY2hlc3Rlci1jaXR5LWdvYWxzLXNwdC1pbnRsL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAWFodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDI0LzAyLzI4L3Nwb3J0L2VybGluZy1oYWFsYW5kLW1hbmNoZXN0ZXItY2l0eS1nb2Fscy1zcHQtaW50bC9pbmRleC5odG1s?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-02-28", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Kristoffer Olsson: Sweden soccer star placed on ventilator due to \u2018acute disease related to the brain\u2019", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Kristoffer Olsson: Sweden soccer star placed on ventilator due to \u2018acute disease related to the brain\u2019</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDIvMjgvc3BvcnQva3Jpc3RvZmZlci1vbHNzb24taG9zcGl0YWwtc3dlZGVuLXN0YXItc3B0LWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-02-28", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Red Bull team principal Christian Horner cleared of wrongdoing following probe into inappropriate behavior", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Red Bull team principal Christian Horner cleared of wrongdoing following probe into inappropriate behavior</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDIvMjgvc3BvcnQvY2hyaXN0aWFuLWhvcm5lci1yZWQtYnVsbC1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0aW9uLXNwdC1pbnRsL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAWRodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDI0LzAyLzI4L3Nwb3J0L2NocmlzdGlhbi1ob3JuZXItcmVkLWJ1bGwtaW52ZXN0aWdhdGlvbi1zcHQtaW50bC9pbmRleC5odG1s?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-02-28", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Yuri Moisevich: Former Belarusian Olympic coach given 5-year ban for \u2018abuse of power\u2019 in treatment of Kristina ...", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Yuri Moisevich: Former Belarusian Olympic coach given 5-year ban for \u2018abuse of power\u2019 in treatment of Kristina ...</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDIvMjgvc3BvcnQveXVyaS1tb2lzZXZpY2gtYmFuLWJlbGFydXMtb2x5bXBpY3Mtc3B0LWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-02-28", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Shohei Ohtani crushes home run for Los Angeles Dodgers in Spring Training debut", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Shohei Ohtani crushes home run for Los Angeles Dodgers in Spring Training debut</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDIvMjgvc3BvcnQvc2hvaGVpLW9odGFuaS1ob21lLXJ1bi1kb2RnZXJzLXNwcmluZy10cmFpbmluZy1zcHQtaW50bC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFraHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyNC8wMi8yOC9zcG9ydC9zaG9oZWktb2h0YW5pLWhvbWUtcnVuLWRvZGdlcnMtc3ByaW5nLXRyYWluaW5nLXNwdC1pbnRsL2luZGV4Lmh0bWw?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-02-28", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Anthony Kim mysteriously disappeared from golf 12 years ago.
