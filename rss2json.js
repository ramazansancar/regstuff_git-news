(TLDR at the end)\n So grateful to have found this sub.\nBecause I re-found sadhguru and he resonated hard this time.\nI\u2019m contemplating flying to one of his centers and dedicating a period of time (at least a consecutive month if not more) only for doing his practices, I want the best guidance and a fully supportive environment for the process.\n\nI know I can do inner engineering online but I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be committed enough until results. That is why I want to move to a center, I\u2019m excited for this and I think it\u2019s going to be perfect for me. Because once there is a system and community around me I can really commit.\n+ I really want to change environment and leave the country I\u2019m living in, it\u2019s full of stress and I want a change.\nAnd I also want to be supported with the right food ideal for the transformation.\n\nSo to my question - I was looking at the Isha website and found the inner engineering physical course in some centers. That\u2019s great, but it\u2019s only 4 days. I emailed Isha and they always just refer me to the program web page.\nMy question is do people stay for long times in the centers? how do I know what center to choose and what course(s) to take after inner engineering? and are there any long term programs in which I can do numerous courses for at least a month (or longer!!) so I can really establish a foundation?\n\nI really want to change my inner experience into a blissful and healthy one. It\u2019s time for me to take responsibility. I just want to do it right and currently have no guidance. Every help would be appreciated, and if you have first hand experience with this that\u2019s a great extra!\ud83d\ude4f\n\nPeace \ud83d\udd49\ufe0f\n\nTLDR; Looking to moving into an Isha center for long period of time and need guidance with choosing and possibilities)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Sadhguru/comments/19547vq/grateful_for_this_sub_question_about_flying_to_a/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "IRS collected more than $520 million in back taxes from delinquent millionaires so far", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/taxes/irs-collected-more-than-520-million-in-back-taxes-from-delinquent-millionaires-so-far/ar-AA1mSlUt", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Camera Calibration", "summary": "Hi, I'm working on a project using the raspberry pi HQ camera with a 6 mm lens and I noticed something strange that I'd like to discuss.
