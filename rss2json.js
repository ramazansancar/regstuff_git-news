"Naming humans after Gods/Devas", "summary": "At the present time, large numbers of Hindus are named after Gods - Rama,Krishna,Lakshmi,Parvati et al.\nBut in scripture - the practice seems to have only barely begun in the Puranas - the famous Narayana, the son of Ajamila who was instrumental in getting Ajamila to Vishnu-loka.\nAny reasons why humans usually did not have Gods' , Devas' names before the Puranas?", "link": "https://hinduism.stackexchange.com/questions/55316/naming-humans-after-gods-devas", "published_js": "2023-06-10", "author": "S K"}, {"title": "What's the proof that Karma is doing it job?", "summary": "I am not that much of a religion virtuoso you will excuse my materialistic reasoning plane  We keep being told that Karma will catch with you . Good Karma and Bad Karma are  awarded appropriately  etc and we take birth to live through our Karmic backlog ( unless we are a divine soul level who choose if they want to be born or not. They dont have net Karma that'll call them )  this nutshell is being conceptualized at various levels and expressed various ways. \nBut observation runs 180 opp theory. For more than 2000+ yrs Hindoos , from Kashmiri Pandits to Mopalas to Assam / Kerala Hindus are being ethnically cleansed so were Christians in Lebanon, Armenia Syria and Jews in Arabia  and Europe . The people who run this world are the biggest sinners. In fact the bigger you are a sinner the more you control the world. Some will say kalyuga time - that was expected and ya da ya . But Karma should hold through all the passages of time ?\nIf Karma has done it's job how come e.g.\n--A mass murderer and pedophile so called prophet who  rapes women , commits incest  and  keeps sex slaves calls himself  so called &quot;messenger of God&quot; and creates a  bestial cult ,forces the world to recognize it as a religion and that religion imposes itself by force in every part of the world ( civilized or third world ) committing acts of  terror .  And the world recognizes that cult as a Semitic Religion ?  Individual people maybe good but I am talking of the philosophy  of that mass murderers cult\n--Colonialists  looted colonies in Africa North America Asia and committed forced conversions ( even though Christianity itself is a peaceful religion and Jesus was an Avtaar that never  said enforce your  religion on others ) that take place even today\n-- Marble mouth politicians in democracies ditch the middle class that voted them in - want to be enslaved and exploited and wallow in corruption and create minority vote banks all over the world\nWhere is Karma ? Deferred to next birth ? yeah so then Gods or   Karmic or Divine or whatever design was in place that defers your karma to next birth ... isn't that a fraudulent design ? because the sinner  is given incentive to keep doing sins ? ( don't worry son - keep doing the most debauched things in this life. We will  send you a bill in your next life. Sinner chuckles - what next life hehe ) .  Based on this I am  forced the conclude that :\n-- Karma is not potent and powerful enough to do its job\nIt gives a nice bail out package to  sinners e.g. the fake prophet who called himself messenger of God or Stalin  or Hitler or Gandhi ( all of them had comfortable lives and died  without all the torture that they created for others )\n-- Someone Bribed Karma\n-- Karmic reservation System\nonly if you beleive in Karma and keep conscience will Karma affect you . So its a reservation system in place. No  Karma for peaceful religion terrorists like D Company but Karma for small acts of greed done by people who have conscience in their within\nIf Karma bad Karma was retributed  in this birth itself sinners wont sin because regardless of whether they have conscience - they know there will be payback time in this birth itself.\nSo here's a small poem I wrote to express my question. Hope you enjoy it and gimme and equally enjoyable answer !\n**The Irony of Karma** \n\nKarma, ancient wisdom we hold dear,\nBalancing wrongs and rights, it's clear.\nBut in this  \ud83c\udf0f world of sin and vice,\nDoes Karma truly bring \u2696\ufe0f justice, precise?\n\nMass murderers and pedophiles calling themselves prophets roam free,\nStarting cults, spreading dread with glee.\nThey claim to be &quot;messengers of God&quot; ,\nForcing beliefs with an iron rod.\n\nThem Liberal &amp; 'Sick-U-Liar'  Politicians deceive with practiced ease,\nColonialists plunder, as they please.\nWhere does Karma reside in this land  \ud83d\udea9?\nBribed   \ud83d\udcb0or overpowered \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f, it seems unplanned.\n\nOr is there a Karmic   &quot;reservation system&quot;    that  excludes  those without  a conscience,\nSo they can  continue their nonsense?\nIf Karma struck in this present life,\nSinners might think twice before causing strife.\n\nAnd so this &quot;Karmic suffering&quot;  lingers on  \u2934\ufe0f\u267b\ufe0f\u2935\ufe0f , \nIn the next birth, where sinners are drawn,\nUnaware they pay for past misdeeds,\nA cycle unending, no solace it breeds.\n\nBut why does the \ud83d\ude4f  Divine decree such fate,\nIn the next birth, where sinners await?\nUnaware they pay for their past transgressions,\nThe cycle persists, no end in succession.\n\nSome say it's the time of Kalyuga,\nWhen evil thrives, and virtue's fewer.\nShould not Karma persist throughout time,\nPunishing the wicked for their crime?\n\nPerhaps Hindus have forgotten their Dharma,\nas they keep thinking of Karma \nTo seek retribution, reclaim what was stolen,\nFrom  those &quot;Religion Of Peace&quot; monsters who practice hate,\nForced conversions and lands they confiscate.\n\nYet until then, we can only ponder,\nIf Karma wields true power, or we wander.\n", "link": "https://hinduism.stackexchange.com/questions/55315/whats-the-proof-that-karma-is-doing-it-job", "published_js": "2023-06-10", "author": "user1874594"}, {"title": "What was the origin of mlecchas according to Hindu scriptures", "summary": "Hinduism scriptures describe to origin of people of India  as they were born out of rishis but how do they describe about the origin o people of other countries which are called as mlecchas and yavanas like Greeks and Mesopotamian civilization which evolve at the same time with Indian civilization", "link": "https://hinduism.stackexchange.com/questions/55313/what-was-the-origin-of-mlecchas-according-to-hindu-scriptures", "published_js": "2023-06-10", "author": "Hindutvadi"}, {"title": "Scriptural references for Jivas getting Moksha in Shiva loka", "summary": "Are there any Scriptural references which state that Jeevas can Attain Moksha on reaching Shiva loka and not fall back in Samsara?", "link": "https://hinduism.stackexchange.com/questions/55310/scriptural-references-for-jivas-getting-moksha-in-shiva-loka", "published_js": "2023-06-10", "author": "Harish"}, {"title": "Why didn't Vali get Moksha upon being killed by Rama?", "summary": "Vali was killed by Rama.
