I tried getting some novelty in one of those 2 tasks and it was a matter of specific data - some intermediate augmentation/processing and more computational power to get a somewhat better-performing domain-specific output. \n\nBut for how long? They will release another huge LLM that can do the same task with a simple prompt. \n\nRecently, we lost a big client because one of the big techs offered what we were doing at 1/10th the cost, they are also subsiding heavily for the time being. (I know they are subsiding because even for in-house computational and processing capacities, this is just absurd pricing) , I also have a vague idea about what model they are using. \n\nWe did catch up in output quality and there is some novelty in length and customization capabilities, but how does one compete with pricing?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nForget all that... I spend 4-5 hours every day learning new architectures, reading papers, and all that to get a hang of what is going on in the industry, but a lot of it is so expensive, time-consuming,  and resource-intensive for a startup, that you can't use most of it as a viable solution in the long run.\n\nWhen I was doing just research, it felt easier to catch up as I got a chance of working on something novel and there were funds/grants, and no industry pressure of missing out. Things are so different in the industry - money/resources/client demands/viability .. all this while big tech may beat it sooner or later, they have more resources, and can subsidize heavily! \n\nIs the only option to combat this, is to keep playing catchup, to work with big tech itself, OR to explore and work on something that they are exploring less? \n\nI know domain-specific novelty and a couple of years of experience are there, and honestly, that's what is keeping us relevant as an NLP startup.
