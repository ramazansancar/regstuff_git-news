I tried getting some novelty in one of those 2 tasks and it was a matter of specific data - some intermediate augmentation/processing and more computational power to get a somewhat better-performing domain-specific output. \n\nBut for how long? They will release another huge LLM that can do the same task with a simple prompt. \n\nRecently, we lost a big client because one of the big techs offered what we were doing at 1/10th the cost, they are also subsiding heavily for the time being. (I know they are subsiding because even for in-house computational and processing capacities, this is just absurd pricing) , I also have a vague idea about what model they are using. \n\nWe did catch up in output quality and there is some novelty in length and customization capabilities, but how does one compete with pricing?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nForget all that... I spend 4-5 hours every day learning new architectures, reading papers, and all that to get a hang of what is going on in the industry, but a lot of it is so expensive, time-consuming,  and resource-intensive for a startup, that you can't use most of it as a viable solution in the long run.\n\nWhen I was doing just research, it felt easier to catch up as I got a chance of working on something novel and there were funds/grants, and no industry pressure of missing out. Things are so different in the industry - money/resources/client demands/viability .. all this while big tech may beat it sooner or later, they have more resources, and can subsidize heavily! \n\nIs the only option to combat this, is to keep playing catchup, to work with big tech itself, OR to explore and work on something that they are exploring less? \n\nI know domain-specific novelty and a couple of years of experience are there, and honestly, that's what is keeping us relevant as an NLP startup.

My teammate actually created the model, and it was accurate (97%). However, when we finally integrated the model into the raspberry pi and captured a new image of an xray which we printed on glossy photo paper to match XRAY paper (where I live, they don't use XRAY clear films as much as before, they opted to use a somewhat glossy paper so we replicated the quality as much as possible) The captured image, which is preprocessed before going into the model, is misclassified and only sometimes does it classify correctly.  \n\n\nWhat we've tried/ some info.  \n1. We changed the Web camera 3 times, the result did not change. \n\n2. We tried to find authentic XRAY paper from actual hospitals, it was hard to find but we managed to get two, the problem remains.   \n3. We tried to picture the printed xray and fed it to the model in a separate computer, the result is accurate as intended, however the same model on the Raspberry pi says otherwise.\n\n4. Lighting. We bought a negatoscope (which is just a light source for the xray, which is diffused by acrylic and the xray paper is placed on top of it)   \n5. The vertical distance between the camera and the xray is 13 inches which we assumed to be the best since the camera covered the whole size of the negatoscope  \n6. We tried to lower down the lighting/ make it lighter.   \nWhat we know:  \n1. Distance and positioning is pivotal.   \n2. Lighting matters  \n3. Material also matters(can't be with normal paper) \n\n4. We can't rule out that the model is also at fault, it maybe because the model isn't accustomed to the captured images. \n\nAny tips?
