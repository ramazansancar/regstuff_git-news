Instead, organizations can explore options such as training an LLM from scratch with less data, using an API from a public LLM, fine-tuning an existing LLM, or using retrieval augmented generation.\n      The author also discusses the cost of training large language models and the potential benefits and drawbacks of using public LLMs, fine-tuning existing LLMs, or training an LLM from scratch.
