A few major things I'm confused about - I'm GPU poor :( so was planning on using AWS sagemaker to deploy the model - the 2 month free plan has 125 hours of m4.xlarge or m5.xlarge instance per month on Inference - would that be enough to set up an endpoint for quantized mistral (I'm thinking 5-bit)? And like if you don't have a GPU yourself and are a broke student what's the go-to for model hosting? Just need it for my final year project so it's not a long-term thing.  \nAlso I'm confused about the quantization types and methods - first out of AWQ, GGUF and GPTQ I'm leaning towards AWQ for it's efficiency, but I've heard that the downside to it is the limited support? If I just want to deploy TheBloke's AWQ model, that shouldn't be anything particularly difficult right? Also is that the only downside to AWQ of could it potentially require more RAM? Also was looking at the deployment methods themselves - openllama, vllama etc. I was leaning towards vllama because again efficiency - has like double the throughput of Huggingface TGI, which I was using until this point. But then saw someone say something about how it might require more VRAM? So advice please - What are my hosting options, what quantization method should I be using, within these v limited resources what are my options for making this model as fast as possible?  \nNote: Ik for most cases it can't be helped and I will have to compromise on model speed, but I want to use the model for metadata extraction of chunks too, and if I'm feeding this model 100s of chunks, I need it to not be slow to the point of impracticality lol.

How far have grammatical parsing approaches gotten?\n\nJust to sketch what an unsupervised grammatical parser would look like (in case this is a novel concept): You want to have a low-dimension sparse auto-encoder-like model classifying phrases into four or five categories whereby phrases in classification B all are all preceded by phrases in classification A and succeeded by phrases in classification C or A (but not more B phrases). The model will read a new word, add it to the bag-of-words in the current phrase and feed it to a phrase parsing model to see if that model decides this bag constitutes a single phrase or if the new word is part of the next phrase, and then either add the word to the current phrase or terminate the phrase before the new word. \n\nIntuitively it seems like the auto-encoding will classify-together phrases of nouns and adjectives and see them as preceding phrases composed of verbs and adverbs; if a verb gets sucked into \"subject\"-labeled phrase-bags it will probably reduce the predictive power of those subject phrases since they may sometimes be immediately followed by an object phrase or new subject rather than a predicate phrase.\n\nEdit: Called positional encoding spatial encoding a couple times.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1bheo6f/after_grammatical_parsing_does_word_order_matter/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "What are my chances of becoming an Computer Vision Engineer", "summary": "I am Robotics grad student (International Student) at Northeastern, will graduate spring 2025.
