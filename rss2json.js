This made me think about the existing approaches to classifying documents, and I quickly realized there are many!  Next is a list of short descriptions of all the approaches I encountered during my studies / working with NLP projects. Which ones do you think / know are the most promising? Do you have other approaches in mind? Looking forward to your comments!\n\nFor context, the documents I am considering are about 500 - 1000 tokens, so they should fit into most recent transformer-based architectures with minimal (if any) truncation. The number of classes is quite low: N=4. When I say encoder model, I refer to encoder-only architectures, e.g., BERT. For the task at hand, I only have access to \\~1000 samples (250 per class)\n\n**Zero-shot with LLMs:** Use any LLM (e.g., llama), provide a short description of the task, describe the labels, and then prompt it to classify the following document. May use constrained generation to output only valid classes.\n\n**Few-shot (in-context learning) with LLMs**: In addition to above, also add one example per class. I like to think of a conversation, where the user already has tasked the model N times to perform the task, e.g. user: &lt;prompt as above&gt;, system: &lt;class a&gt;, ...\n\n**PEFT with LLMs:** Fine-tune LLM with, e.g. LORA adapters on the task. This is probably the best approach, but I haven't looked into this so far.\n\n**Unsupervised with encoder model:** Use any encoder model, e.g., BERT or Sentence-BERT, compute embeddings for every document, and cluster them with, e.g., k-means where k = N. Now, I have to map the clusters to the classes manually.\n\n**Few-shot with encoder model:** Use any encoder model, insert adapters (e.g., bottleneck adapter), add classification head, and fine-tune with, e.g., 8-64 examples per class.\n\n**Few-shot with encoder model (2)**: I was thinking about the SetFit Library. They first fine-tune a sentence transformer model with sentence pairs. A sentence pair is considered positive (cosine similarity = 1) if both are from the same class, negative (0) otherwise. Then they train a traditional classifier with the embeddings as input.\n\n**Fully-fine tuning with encoder model:** Use any encoder model, add classification head, and fine-tune with all examples. As a variation, one could freeze the encoder model and only train the classification head.\n\n**Train** ***traditional classifier*** **with embeddings as features:** Use any encoder model and compute embeddings for each document. The embeddings are input to a traditional classifier, e.g. logistic regression. But some also train more advanced classifiers, e.g., Bi-LSTMs, on top of embeddings.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1avg7bo/approaches_to_document_classification/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "New Sigbla release v1.24.2 - a framework for working with data in tables, using the Kotlin programming language.
