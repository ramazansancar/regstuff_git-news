A little while ago I built a simple python program for hiding files inside images (small fun side project) and recently decided it was time to take it out of the grave 'cause I'd love seeing people contribute to it, as it, being my most starred project, has a soft spot in my heart:\n\n[https://github.com/JoshuaKasa/van-gonography](https://github.com/JoshuaKasa/van-gonography)\n\nI would like to see it grow even more and expand on features and such, plus, I love working on projects with people and seeing others contribute to mine. I'd highly appreciate EVERY kind of contribution, organizing code, hinting, anything! Even a small documentation change can make the difference!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1916ng5/hiding_files_inside_images/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "European researchers: \u00d6tzi the Iceman came from Anatolia; He was dark-skinned and bald.", "summary": "", "link": "https://tr.euronews.com/2023/08/16/avrupali-arastirmacilar-buzadam-otzi-anadoludan-geldi-koyu-tenli-ve-keldi", "author": "None"}, {"title": "NYC is more ethnically diverse, less racially segregated, report finds", "summary": "", "link": "https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-is-more-ethnically-diverse-less-racially-segregated-report-finds", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Supervised nlp tasks in the era of LLMs", "summary": "", "link": "/r/LLMDevs/comments/190rrke/supervised_nlp_tasks_in_the_era_of_llms/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Mouse filmed tidying up man's shed every night", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-67902966", "author": "None"}, {"title": "This AI knows where you took which photo", "summary": "1/ The PIGEON and PIGEOTTO AI models developed by Stanford students can accurately predict where a photo was taken, which can have both useful and potentially abusive applications.\r\n\r\n2/ PIGEON was trained on more than 500,000 Google Street View images and can guess the correct country 92 percent of the time, while PIGEOTTO, trained on four million Flickr and Wikipedia images, needs only a single image as input.\r\n\r\n3/ The researchers emphasize that they want to stimulate important discussions about the application of such technologies.
