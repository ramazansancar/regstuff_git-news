I have followed this community for a while and found many great solutions from other's posts, but this time I'd like to give back.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am a software and web developer. I code mainly in Python, the AMP stack (apache, php, mysql) + JS and LESS but I do have a fair bit of experience with C++ (arduino) and other languages. I have programmed in some way for just under a decade. I started with python in year 5 at primary school, I am now taking a Digital Production, Design and Development T Level.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am finishing my college course soon and would like a side/main project to work on while I decide on a future to pursue. I am **not** expecting this to take off and get thousands of github stars or produce an income; I just want to create something that people will find **genuinely useful** and to improve both my programming ability and my collaboration experience. I have only ever programmed by myself or with 1 other person, so the potential to somewhat experience what a real job (or just a collaborative environment) might be like would be hugely valuable.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo, what alternatives are you looking for or what do you wish existed?

I did get a very barebones version running, but nothing that I was happy enough with to call a MVP or publish publicly, mainly because I just wasn't engaged enough and didn't have the resources to fully commit. However, (unless circumstances change) I will soon have all the free time in the world to be able to commit pretty much fully to whatever this project will be, so this time I do hope to publish a MVP on GitHub and then continue improving and building upon it, possibly even with other contributors.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIf there are any details / specifics / info you would like to know or you think I should include in this post, feel free to reach out.
