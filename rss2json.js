Beneath that was a sambaqui (mound of pottery, shells, and bones). This discovery challenges existing theories on human settlement in the Americas, suggesting earlier habitation than previously thought, thus adding to the already very heated debate.\n* ['Lost' 4,000-Year-Old Tomb Rediscovered](https://www.rte.ie/news/munster/2024/0118/1427170-lost-tomb-kerry/) \u2014 A \"lost\" 4,000-year-old tomb has been rediscovered on the Dingle Peninsula in Ireland. Known as Alt\u00f3ir na Gr\u00e9ine (the sun altar), the site was believed to have been destroyed in the 1840s but was recently found by a local folklorist. He even found some of the large stones in situ. Thought to be a wedge tomb from the early Bronze Age, it is noted for its potential cosmological significance, possibly aligning with the sun. Hopefully, more to come on this!\n* [Roman Villa Complex Found at Miseno](https://www.heritagedaily.com/2024/01/roman-villa-complex-found-at-miseno/150244) \u2014 Archaeologists have unearthed a Roman villa complex on the shores of Miseno, Italy, located at the northwestern end of the Bay of Naples. Dated to the 1st century CE, around the time of Mount Vesuvius' eruption, this villa features ten large rooms constructed across various periods. It has opus reticulatum \u2014 a facing used for cement walls. Pliny the Elder lived in Miseno at the time and was the praefectus in charge of the naval fleet. There is some speculation that this could have been his home.\n* [2,700-Year-Old Temple with Altar Overflowing with Jewel-Studded Offerings Unearthed on Greek Island](https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/2700-year-old-temple-with-altar-overflowing-with-jewel-studded-offerings-unearthed-on-greek-island) \u2014 In Greece, a 2,700-year-old temple has been discovered next to the Temple of Amarysia Artemis on Evia island. This newly found temple, featuring a horseshoe-shaped altar, contained numerous offerings including pottery, vases, jewelry, amulets, and figurines. Some pottery predates the temple, suggesting the altar may have originally been outdoors. The temple underwent modifications following a fire in the sixth century BCE. Beneath the temple, dry stone walls from a different building were found, along with bronze figurines of bulls and a ram. And they also found remnants of buildings from the 8th and 9th centuries BCE.\n* [Archaeologists Find Intact Medieval Gauntlet](https://www.heritagedaily.com/2024/01/archaeologists-find-intact-medieval-gauntlet/150272) \u2014 A 14th-century gauntlet was discovered in Kyburg, Switzerland near Kyburg Castle. This rare artifact is a right-hand glove made of iron plates linked like scales on a leather or textile base. It is the oldest such gauntlet ever found in the region. Also found were a medieval weaving cellar which was destroyed by a fire and traces of a forge, as evidenced by a mold and 50 smithing objects.\n\nHope you enjoyed this abridged version of [Ancient Beat](https://www.ancientbeat.com/).

We present  **Group Anything with Radiance Fields** (**GARField**), an approach for  decomposing 3D scenes into a hierarchy of semantically meaningful groups  from posed image inputs. To do this we embrace group ambiguity through  physical scale: by optimizing a scale-conditioned 3D affinity feature  field, a point in the world can belong to different groups of different  sizes. We optimize this field from a set of 2D masks provided by Segment  Anything (SAM) in a way that respects coarse-to-fine hierarchy, using  scale to consistently fuse conflicting masks from different viewpoints.  From this field we can derive a hierarchy of possible groupings via  automatic tree construction or user interaction. We evaluate GARField on  a variety of in-the-wild scenes and find it effectively extracts groups  at many levels: clusters of objects, objects, and various subparts.  GARField inherently represents multi-view consistent groupings and  produces higher fidelity groups than the input SAM masks. GARField's  hierarchical grouping could have exciting downstream applications such  as 3D asset extraction or dynamic scene understanding.
