Traditionally, the change in tech is thought to have been an abrupt event that enabled us to outcompete Neanderthals.

Henbane is poisonous and can be used for its medicinal or psychoactive properties. It was documented by ancient historians and physicians for its sedative and analgesic effects. The container and seeds seem to have been left as an offering in a pit.\n* [Possible Ancient Game Boards Identified in Kenya]( \u2014 In Kenya's Lewa Wildlife Conservancy, archaeologists have found rock surfaces with rows of shallow pits, believed to be ancient game boards for a two-person strategy game called Mancala.

Found in a former Roman cemetery, the bed, alongside five oak coffins, dates back to between 43-410 CE. The bed was made from oak and featured carved feet and joints connected by wooden pegs. It was preserved by the waterlogged conditions near the River Fleet. According to Michael Marshall, \u201c*We didn\u2019t know that people were buried in these kinds of Roman burial beds at all. That\u2019s something that there is no previous evidence for from Britain*.\u201d Personal objects like beads, a glass vial, and a lamp with a defeated gladiator design were uncovered elsewhere in the cemetery.\n* [UE Archaeologists Conduct Study of Amazonian Cave Homes]( \u2014 In the Amazon Basin, researchers uncovered evidence of early human occupation in rock shelters dating back around 13,000 years. These sites, located in northwest Colombia, reveal insights into the lives of some of South America's earliest inhabitants. Artifacts include vibrant cave paintings made with ochre, stone tools, and evidence of plant management and animal hunting. Findings also indicate the use of these shelters for both domestic and ritual activities, with a continuous human presence until the 17th century. According to Jo Osborn, \u201c*All of the rock shelters exhibit ochre paintings from the earliest occupations, indicating that those pioneers were also recording and making sense of this new world they encountered*.\u201d\n\nHope you enjoyed this abridged version of [Ancient Beat]( Have a great weekend!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/1anfy08/this_weeks_archaeological_news_leisure/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Converting Grayscale to Color Image using Color Maps", "summary": "I've been tackling a problem lately where I'm attempting to convert grayscale images to color, utilizing color maps from both Matplotlib and OpenCV.

I've always wished that the incentives were better for maintainers so I could justify more time there, but they just aren't.  It's crazy to me how little FOSS maintainers are compensated even for projects that are critical for our industry.\n\nIt occurred to me that one approach that might help might be:  Instead of just using MIT license for everything, publish projects with a dual license - one for pure open source and another for commercial that just requires _any_ payment amount.  So something like a dual license of GPL and also a modified version of MIT (where one penny or more needs to be paid to enable).\n\nI know that some projects have gone this direction of dual license with GPL (eg. MySQL, Qt) but the commercial use side of the license is way more complex than I would want.  I think just _any_ amount would be best and would encourage users to donate more if they want to help support it.\n\nAs far as I know, there isn't a modified MIT license like this that exists, so would need to be created.
