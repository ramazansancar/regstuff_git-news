The goal is to build a validated Top2Vec model capable of operating in production on a Kafka infrastructure. I am focusing on a fixed argument, particularly on a (rather small) dataset of conversations whose topics are often not precisely specified. For this reason, my supervisor suggested following a specific path.\n\nOne of the main challenges of Top2Vec (as well as Topic Modeling in general) is validating the results of the clusters obtained. Besides the various techniques that one can employ to evaluate cluster quality (i.e., Coherence Metrics, Perplexity), human evaluation is often regarded as the best technique, albeit the most time-consuming one. Therefore, relying solely on these metrics is insufficient to train a reliable model.\n\nMy supervisor suggested using a second model (I chose LDA mainly for hardware constraints) and considering it as the **ground truth** (see [Evaluation of Clustering, a Stanford lecture](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/evaluation-of-clustering-1.html)), **once optimized**. Theoretically, a \"good\" Top2Vec model would then form clusters as similar as possible to LDA ones. However, my supervisor didn't explain much further, as he obviously wanted me to put effort into finding the best solution.\n\nHere's the approach that I chose, but I am unsure if it is 100% correct:\n\n1. Train-Test Split\n2. Preprocessing\n3. Performed Nested Cross-Validation on the Training Set to find the optimal LDA model within a given parameter space. I examined the topics formed and ensured that those *K* topics actually made sense.\n4. I trained the Top2Vec Model and performed Hierarchical Reduction to obtain *K* topics exactly.\n5. I checked whether LDA assignments on the test set were equal to those of Top2Vec on the same test set.\n6. Computed evaluation cluster metrics such as Adjusted RAND, Purity, and NMI.\n\nA few doubts here:\n\n1. Even though the results wouldn't change that much, perhaps I should perform evaluation on the training set instead of the test set? So to leave the test set for production purposes only and see how Top2Vec behaves on new data?\n2. Is it incorrect to set a fixed number of Top2Vec topics (equal to the number of ground truth labels, i.e., LDA ones) instead of letting Top2Vec determine its own number of topics? It's worth noting that the metrics also function in cases where there is a discrepancy between the number of ground truth labels (LDA) and cluster labels (Top2Vec). Personally, I don't believe there would be any significant difference since clusters are only gathered after the normal algorithm runs, and there's no a priori determination of cluster size.\n\nThanks for helping!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/18mr63z/evaluation_of_clustering_in_topic_modeling_is_my/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "I created Sadhguru AI.

Through a unified  framework, GLEE accomplishes detection, segmentation, tracking,  grounding, and identification of arbitrary objects in the open world  scenario for various object perception tasks. Adopting a cohesive  learning strategy, GLEE acquires knowledge from diverse data sources  with varying supervision levels to formulate general object  representations, excelling in zero-shot transfer to new data and tasks.  Specifically, we employ an image encoder, text encoder, and visual  prompter to handle multi-modal inputs, enabling to simultaneously solve  various object-centric downstream tasks while maintaining  state-of-the-art performance. Demonstrated through extensive training on  over five million images from diverse benchmarks, GLEE exhibits  remarkable versatility and improved generalization performance,  efficiently tackling downstream tasks without the need for task-specific  adaptation. By integrating large volumes of automatically labeled data,  we further enhance its zero-shot generalization capabilities.  Additionally, GLEE is capable of being integrated into Large Language  Models, serving as a foundational model to provide universal  object-level information for multi-modal tasks. We hope that the  versatility and universality of our method will mark a significant step  in the development of efficient visual foundation models for AGI  systems.
