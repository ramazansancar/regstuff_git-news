In this work, we propose **AdamL**, a novel variant of the  Adam optimizer, that takes into account the loss function information  to attain better generalization results. We provide sufficient  conditions that together with the Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality, ensure  the linear convergence of AdamL. As a byproduct of our analysis, we  prove similar convergence properties for the EAdam, and AdaBelief  optimizers. Experimental results on benchmark functions show that AdamL  typically achieves either the fastest convergence or the lowest  objective function values when compared to Adam, EAdam, and AdaBelief.  These superior performances are confirmed when considering deep learning  tasks such as training convolutional neural networks, training  generative adversarial networks using vanilla convolutional neural  networks, and long short-term memory networks. Finally, in the case of  vanilla convolutional neural networks, AdamL stands out from the other  Adam's variants and does not require the manual adjustment of the  learning rate during the later stage of the training.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/192z9lh/adaml_a_fast_adaptive_gradient_method/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Conveyor OCR advice", "summary": "I've built a system to read date codes printed on packaging as pieces pass on a conveyor.

I just want to find what suits me the best, It could be from Isha or from some other yogic school. I hope you understand what I meant, I thank you in advance for your response.
