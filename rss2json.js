I've explored breath watching independently and found it beneficial, but Isha's methods appear to require extensive commitment through advanced programs just to get initiated into a simple breath watching. Despite trying Shoonya and Shakti Chalana, I struggled to maintain the practices. Furthermore, after being consistent for a year, the prolonged hours of sadhana started to feel increasingly burdensome on the body.  \nMore like something I felt compelled to do rather than something I found joyful.\n\nAfter completing various advanced programs, I'm beginning to question the necessity of maintaining such a rigorous practice regimen.

They all say the same thing along the lines of \"if a point is within the surface, it is assigned a negative value, if it is on the surface it's zero, and outside the surface it's positive\".\n\nThis made sense initially, but then I started looking at my point cloud data and trying to assign TSDF to a voxelized grid of that data. How does one determine what the nearest \"surface\" is? I have no knowledge of what the point cloud data is representing. How do people generally handle these conversions?\n\nI found some Matlab script from 8 years ago that is a truncated distance function, but does not have signed distances and I don't know how to adapt
