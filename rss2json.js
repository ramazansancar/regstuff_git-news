Currently I am struggling to explain things as AI articles are either too technically-detailed *(too boring for the business people)* or are way too basic and don't capture the actual challenges.  \nHave you encountered similar issues? How do you tackle them? Do you think everyone who uses AI should have some basic knowledge of how things work?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1b5h7jt/ai_misalignments/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How positive male role models are detoxifying the social media \u2018manosphere\u2019", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/mar/02/positive-male-role-models-detoxifying-social-media-manosphere", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Singapore to Build World\u2019s Largest Facility to Remove Carbon From the Ocean", "summary": "", "link": "https://time.com/6836259/singapore-equatic-ocean-carbon-dioxide-removal-facility-largest/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Mahashivratri is one of the largest and most significant among the sacred festivals of India.

For some languages, there are literally 10+ libraries that do the same thing and while I do agree that, e.g., two or more libraries might in essence do the same but in wildly different ways (e.g.,  DOM vs. SAX in the realm of XML processing), often this is not the case.\n\nToday, after I saw a post of some guy advertising the *n*\\-th JS ORM for Postgres, I thought: \"Why?\" Don't get me wrong, I think it's wonderful we all share our projects, ideas, goals, etc. and this is why I am still here after a decade. But why not contribute to already existing libraries instead of starting anew? Why not expand on what we have already? If you don't like a project's governance, then fork it and implement your changes. Maybe I am missing the point here, but in the time I've been part of the community I have seen many wheels being reinvented and just think it's a shame. Reinventing the wheel is fine for practice, but eventually you move on and do original work, at least imho.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1b5d28u/what_do_you_think_of_the_problem_of_fragmentation/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Email client for terminal with free SMTP server.", "summary": "I'm attempting to send emails from the terminal using Aerc and I'm in search of a free SMTP email server.
