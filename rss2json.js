They said that it was all too true that many of their caregivers had at least one partner who was extremely jealous that the caregiver was spending more time with the recipient than with them, so that it caused problems in the long run, forcing them to quit. I didn't know that I myself would experience this very same problem, but up until a week ago I thought everything was all fine and dandy. Then they dropped the bombshell that they, too, had to quit for fear of their safety being compromised.\nIs there anything that I can do to ensure that I get someone who won't have that problem?
