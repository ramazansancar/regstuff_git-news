In his translation,\nin the Sambhava Up-Parva in Adi Parva, Chapters 96 and 99 tell 2 different stories of how Vasus became River Ganga's children and why Bhishma lived while other Vasus didn't have to live for long on Earth.\nAccording to Chapter 96:\nReason behind Vasus getting cursed - Vasus to Ganga, \u2018O queen of rivers, we have been cursed, for a venial fault, by the illustrious Vasishtha in anger. The foremost of excellent Rishis, Vasishtha, had been engaged in his twilight adorations and seated as he was, he could not be seen by us. We crossed him in ignorance. Therefore, in wrath he hath cursed us, saying, Be ye born among men!\u2019\nReason behind Bhishma bound to live a longer life on Earth than other Vasus -\nAlthough Ganga agreed to be the mother of the Vasus, they asked her to throw the children after birth, into the water, so that they may be rescued soon without having to live on earth for any length of time. But Ganga said that she had to give Shantanu at least one son that lives, to which Vasus reply, \u2018We shall each contribute an eighth part of our respective energies. With the sum thereof, thou shall have one son according to thy and his wishes.'\nAccording to Chapter 99:\nReason behind Vasus getting cursed - Vasus and their wives were enjoying themselves in the forest when the wife of Dyu spotted an excellent cow and asked her husband to steal it. The cow was Nandini, daughter of Surabhi, and was owned by the sage Vashishtha. With the help of his brothers, Dyu stole Nandini. When Vasishtha realised what happened he cursed the Vasus to be born as mortals.\nReason behind Bhishma bound to live a longer life on Earth than other Vasus -\nUpon their pleading, Vashishta showed mercy and told the other seven Vasus that they will be liberated soon after their birth. However, Dyu being the protagonist of the theft was cursed to endure a longer life on the earth.\nMy question is why are there 2 different stories behind Vasus' (including Bhishma) birth on Earth. Is the translated version missing something or is there a reason behind the 2 different stories?", "link": "https://hinduism.stackexchange.com/questions/55600/story-behind-vashishthas-curse-to-vasus-and-bhishmas-birth", "published_js": "2023-06-28", "author": "CCCC"}, {"title": "Where does the story of Ganesha taking the form of a crow come from?", "summary": "There is a story about Lord Ganesha taking the form of a crow that I've seen in many places online. Here is Indian Time Zone's version:\n\nBy this time, Sage Agastya had traveled to the Kodagu mountains (in Coorg). Lord Ganesha then took the appearance of a crow and landed on the edge of the kamandalu, while Agastya Muni was involved in meditation. The sage then realized this and raised his hands to remove the crow. But while departing, the divine crow tipped and knocked over the sacred pot. Thus River Kaveri was poured on the ground and she started to flow in to the land, which is now known as Talakaveri (Talacauvery).\nThe divine crow then took the appearance of a small boy. The holy sage realized that the small boy was playing some trick. Agastya Muni clenched his fists and tried to strike on the head of the boy. The small boy then ran away and the sage followed him. Eventually the boy took the form of Lord Ganesha and appeared in front of Agastya. The sage became astounded to discover that the boy was Ganesha. As penance, Agastya Muni started hit his own head with his clenched fists. The Lord then stopped him and blessed the sage with wisdom.\n\nI'm interested in knowing where this story comes from- is it retold in any scripture? Is it at least referenced to in a scripture? If it's not, and it's simply a folktale, what is its origin and significance?", "link": "https://hinduism.stackexchange.com/questions/55599/where-does-the-story-of-ganesha-taking-the-form-of-a-crow-come-from", "published_js": "2023-06-27", "author": "CDR"}, {"title": "Are there multiple versions of how Ganesa got an elephant head?", "summary": "In addition to the main version (Siva cutting off his head)\nBard AI says\n\nAnother story says that Ganesha was born with an elephant head. This story is often told to explain why Ganesha is associated with wisdom and strength. The elephant is a symbol of wisdom in many cultures, and its strength is evident in its large size and powerful trunk.\n\n.........................\n\nIn another version, Ganesha's head was cut off by a demon named Jambavan. Jambavan was a powerful demon who was trying to steal Parvati's jewels. Ganesha stood in his way, and Jambavan cut off his head. When Parvati saw what had happened, she was furious. She cursed Jambavan, and he was turned into a monkey. Parvati then asked Vishnu to find the head of the first animal he saw. Vishnu found the head of a white elephant, and he brought it back to Parvati. Parvati placed the elephant head on Ganesha's body, and Ganesha was brought back to life.\n\nAre these stories based on scripture?", "link": "https://hinduism.stackexchange.com/questions/55598/are-there-multiple-versions-of-how-ganesa-got-an-elephant-head", "published_js": "2023-06-27", "author": "S K"}, {"title": "Verses number in upanishads", "summary": "I want a list of upanishads in a specific order.
