According to the story, Kusha's twin brother, Lava, was playing in the forest when he wandered off and was lost. Valmiki, the sage who was raising the boys, was worried and searched for Lava everywhere. When he could not find him, Valmiki used his divine powers to create a second son from a piece of kusha grass.
