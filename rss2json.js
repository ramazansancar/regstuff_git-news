After that, I completed my mandala and practiced every day but from November 2023 I stopped practising and then again I started but I am not doing it consistently. I always give myself a reason that I am busy and I give more importance to work. When I stopped Shambhavi everything negative came back very strongly. My old patterns came back and I started smoking weed, and cigarettes and also drank alcohol. But suddenly something happened during the past week and my urges have stopped. I don\u2019t feel like smoking or drinking. I still think every day that tomorrow I will wake up early and do shambhavi but my job timings are 8 am to 9 pm. I need help in getting back to doing Shambhavi every day. Can anyone provide me with guidance? Did anyone who stopped and started back can provide me insights? \n\nAny help would be appreciated.

After several training iterations, the models trained with the RL methods outperformed the fine-tuning models by almost 10%, which was the limit of the tested methods.\r\n\ud83d\udc49 According to the team, one of the main limitations for further improving the logical capabilities of language models is a strong exploration.
