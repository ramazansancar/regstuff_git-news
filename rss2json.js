I'm looking for suggestions and recommendations (and what to avoid) in ML for a NLP project.\n\n  \n\n\nTask:\n\n  \n\n\nMake Wikipedia search easier and add better structured data for Wikipedia\n\n  \n\n\nPhase 1 - Build a simple multi class classification system\n\n  \n\n\nInitial idea is to build a hybrid ML + heuristic rules to define a set of 30\u201480 top-level topic classes and tag each article with a set of class labels (with confidence scores).\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nPhase 2 - Add deeper sub-classes for popular searched items\n\n  \n\n\nFor subject areas with lots of articles (like Person, Music, Film, Sport, War, Geography, etc) subdivided the class label using infobox (or Wikidata) features, so we have smaller sub-classes. This involves lots of HTML parsing to structured data and adding model fields to a article classification. Example heuristics:\n\n  \n\n\nPerson \u2014&gt; Occupation label, or political office. Also if they are alive or deceased. Also if they are a real of \"virtual\" person (character in TV, Movie, Book etc)\n\n  \n\n\nMusic \u2014&gt; Band or instrument or theory. If album or single or video.\n\n  \n\n\nTV/Movies \u2014&gt; Cast, Production, Years, series/episodes\n\n  \n\n\nSport \u2014&gt; Individual or team members. Location. Competitions, Accolades.\n\n  \n\n\nWar \u2014&gt; Years and location. Participants\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nPhase 3 - Gather missed articles that weren't labeled correctly\n\n  \n\n\nUse weak unsupervised learning, to find articles that were mislabelled in step 1 and 2 and add their meta data to the classification.\n\n  \n\n\nThere are a number of existing article classification systems for Wikipedia that used different methods and different sources of data to infer article labels. Some are better classifications than others, I'm hoping to use an ensemble approach to combine these into a unified classification system using weak learning tricks.\n\n  \n\n\nPhase 4 - Create a Knowledge Graph using article NER triples\n\n  \n\n\nOnce I have a document classification system, I'll focus on build an graph of in document \"knowledge\". I'll combine structured data from infoboxes, section headings, lists, table and citations to create some high-level KG tuples.\n\n  \n\n\nThen use link text and NER parser to build low-level tuples for the Knowledge Graph.\n\n  \n\n\nMy hope here is to decompose full articles into chunks, like sections and paragraphs. So eventually we can build a search tool that is not dependent on article titles alone.\n\n  \n\n\nPhase 5 - Improve KG connections and weight/score links based on Page View\n\n  \n\n\nCombine Page View statistics and internal HTTP links to other articles, to make more connects on the Knowledge Graph and weigh them based on user page views. This weighted graph should help rank results much the same way PageRank used to work in the early days of Google.\n\n  \n\n\nPhase 6 - Score articles based on their Citations and Refereneces\n\n  \n\n\nWikipedia articles should be well cited. Add a weighting to the KG for article \"quality\" based on Wikipedia Citation labels and based on reputation of Citations that link to 3rd party sites.\n\n  \n\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\n  \n\n\nAny suggestions or ways to simplify or NLP/ML tools I should use, I'd be delighted to hear your thoughts", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/18w2sb1/asking_for_advice_on_my_approach_for_following/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Isha Kriya Concern/Car Accident", "summary": "I was in a car accident one year ago as of 1/9/2023, breaking several vertebrae in my neck and back. After fusions and a couple of other surgergies, I now use a walker with numerous issues (I'm only 53) . I had already been homeless for 3 yrs. prior and had only had my apartment 4 months before the accident, so I was in a deep depression/anxiety cycle that just escalated. While homless I lost my mother and she never got to see me get the place she thought I deserved so much. I have no other emotional spport and this last year has seen me completely shut myself off from the world. \n\n6 weeks ago, I was on YT, which I had never really used before, literally looking for any source of comfort/answers/meaning/why...and I saw Sadhguru. I watched a couple of his videos and thought he made the kind of sense I understood and downloaded the app, which started me on my road with Isha Kriya! I have been a sponge, regardless, with Sadhguru's teaching, philosophy, and humor. My first week with Isha Kriya was amazing and by the 3 day I found tears overflow onto my cheeks. I wasn't crying...I still don't know what to think and it happens often. The change in me is crystal clear. The world around me is changing and the people around me are changing with it. I practice 2 times a day just for the peace it brings me...\n\nMy concern are the fusions. Am I getting the actual, or the full effect of Isha Kriya or am I wanting it to be so? I've seen my imaging and it isn't pretty and definitely does not look like a normally alligned spine. If someone could help me with this, I would appreciate further education, as I enjoy the practice so much, however do not want to be doing a yogic practice improperly that I actually can't help. The fusions keep me from so many of the other practices...I would like to think that the fusions would help reverberate for me but that is totally tongue in cheek...\n\nAnd to be completely bare, my economic situation has not changed. I was able to buy Inner Engineering last month for myself, for Christmas secondhand, and I will definitely buy others when I can find them and can afford them. I say this, only because I'm unable to afford courses etc. If someone can point me in the right direction for information or has it outright, I would be so grateful...\n\nPeace be with all\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Sadhguru/comments/18vzilz/isha_kriya_concerncar_accident/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Syrian Archaeologist Khaled al-Asaad pictured with a 2nd Century Roman Palmyrene family\u2019s funerary relief; Palmyra, Syria.

Project closure.\n\nEngineering involves:\n1. Data collection, labeling and training.\n2. Model conversion to TensorRT.\n3. Pipeline built using DeepStream for optimal latency.\n4. Lots of post-processing rules to address edge cases.\n5. Inference is usually done on expensive edge servers.\n\nWhat I don't like:\n1. Point 2 of project flow. Since requirements are negotiated by the business team, it often involves unclear/unrealistic targets that you somehow have to deliver.\n2. No standardized code structure. Different teams do stuff differently, often redundantly redoing things that have already been done by another team working on another project.\n3. Ambiguous targets. The business team and clients always speaks in terms of accuracy, because that's the only metric they can comprehend. But accuracy isn't always a suitable metric. Also there's no proper business definition of the term. It's just thrown around randomly.\n4. Most things in CV literature do not perform as well as claimed in the production environment.\n5. No standardized process for data collection post deployment.\n\nWhat I like:\n1. I like everything except the above.\n\nJust wanted to share this here. Maybe I will get some comments saying how similar this is to what they do. Maybe not. Maybe the complete opposite. Would be nice to know how it works in other places.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/18vwpra/what_i_do/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Life Situation", "summary": "Namaskam. I currently in an entangled situation and I am been having many child births ever since 26 yrs through treatment as my husband had problem and now I am 40 yrs old.
