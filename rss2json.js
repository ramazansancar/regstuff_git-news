We aimed to simplify capturing and reporting bugs by automatically gathering all necessary data like screenshots, session replays, network calls, and logs. It's been a journey of constant learning and iterating based on feedback.  \nThe latest feature we're excited about is the [AI Bug Resolver]( which provides immediate code snippets to fix identified bugs. We believe that making Quash open source will not only improve our tool with the community's expertise but also contribute to the broader development and QA ecosystems.\n\nBut here's more news: we're not stopping at Android. We're currently working on supporting Flutter, and our vision includes making Quash compatible with all major mobile development frameworks.  \nAs we take these steps towards open-sourcing Quash and expanding its reach, I'm reaching out for advice on best practices, pitfalls to avoid, and strategies to engage and grow our open-source community?\n\nCatch you in the comments or DMs!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1aleqyr/seeking_advice_making_our_qa_tool_open_source/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "3D Scan of the Tomb of Nefertari, Valley of the Queens (QV66)", "summary": "", "link": "https://mused.org/en/tours/923/tomb-of-nefertari-valley-of-the-queens", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How does ncurses, after exiting, leave the terminal as it was?", "summary": "Let's take a very simple example \n\n\n    #include &lt;ncurses.h&gt;\n    #include &lt;string&gt;\n    \n    int main() {\n      initscr();\n      int x, y;\n      getmaxyx(stdscr, y, x);\n    \n      std::string output = \"Hello, world!
