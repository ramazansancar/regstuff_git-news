Though I have never solely dedicated my life to Sadhana, through my own search for meaning and purpose of life I have grown and matured spiritually significantly over the years, it's always been a push to get better and grow. But this sometimes is also very painful, as I experience loneliness and a disconnect form everything everybody's doing. I used to have multiple relationships, addictions all in the hope of covering this emptiness I feel within me. \n\nBut today, I was going through a similar phase, sitting in my chair thinking, I had an epiphany. Why should I be feeling this empty when I should be feeling happy and brusting with happiness?? It finally struck me, I have heard Sadhguru talk about being pleasant and joyful but I dismissed it as something only normal people aspire for. I have a hustler mindset, so my thinking was if I'm joyful, I'll loose my drive to achieve things and might settle down for less. \n\nAfter all these years, I have not successfully achieved what I was longing for. I see the problem now. I was never happy. I see that having a pleasant state of mind can only help stick to the process. So, I want to reconsider my decision and incorporate practices in my life which will help me be more pleasant and happy within me. I am still in my early 20s trying to build a life and have huge aspirations. I don't want to let my inner emptiness stand in the way. Please suggest me what practices must I start following and incorporating in my daily schedule to make the hustle joyful.
