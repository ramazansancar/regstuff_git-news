We all know that performing a convolution operation on an image and a kernel is mathematically equivalent to first applying a Fourier Transform to both the input image and the kernel, followed by a multiplication of their Fourier forms, and concluding with an inverse Fourier Transform on the result. Given that the latter approach is far more efficient, I am wondering if there is any research going into this direction.\n\nMy main questions are:\n\n* Have there been any successful implementations of the use of Fourier Transforms within CNNs?\n* If so, how does this approach compare in terms of performance and efficiency with traditional convolution operations?\n* If not, why?\n\nThank you.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1bbaeat/d_fourier_transformbased_convolutional_neural/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "What are some popular discord servers for people to share and discuss their CV research or paper?", "summary": "So I learned that my colleagues who work in NLP follow some discord servers to get updated tech.
