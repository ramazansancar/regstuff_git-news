I've since moved away but my parents still attend. It is in a location where there is no cell service and the church has no internet connectivity. The church was likely built in the early part of the 20th century. The area with the pulpit is at the front of the church in front of smallish alcove. There is a lectern there where the speaker can talk and read from a book. The church area has a middle aisle and wooden pews on each side. About 8 deep. The area is about 30' deep from the lectern to the entry door and 20' wide from side to side. It has a high, cathedral type ceiling which is probably about 25' to 30' high at the peak. The walls and floor are wood. There are no curtains or soft surfaces other than the cushions on the pews.  The church does not currently have an audio system.\n\nI've been asked to paint the interior of this area along with a few others and have been tasked with setting it up with a wireless microphone and a couple of speakers. Ideally I'd like the speakers to be mounted at the front of the church in the two corners up 10-15' from the floor on either side of the lectern. I need volume control as well. I don't have the ability to get behind the walls so I will likely have to use corner cable concealer or some other type of wall mounted conduit. It would be good if we could somehow bluetooth or direct connect a phone, tablet or laptop to this set up as well in case they want to do Christmas music or something similar. It should be easy to use and not fussy from a technical point of view.\n\nThe church is not poor but we also don't want to spend $1,000's on the audio system. Can you help recommend system components that would allow us to meet these goals and constraints?
