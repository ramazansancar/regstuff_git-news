Rust shitposts aside, is referencing a project's implementation the same as being a derivative work of it? For instance say you wanted to render a PNG on an OLED display with a microcontroller, and to do that you looked at code that does what you want to learn how to do it, but never directly copied any component of it. (beyond the extreme basics that really can't be done any other way; there are only so many ways to index an array) \n\nWhat if the thing your referencing is only a small subset of a much larger project, or you're referencing the larger project for compatibility integration? For instance say you want to make some ESP32 sensors communicate with eachother and, even though you don't want them to be used as communicators themselves, you implement a subset of Meshtastic so that they do technically act as Meshtastic nodes to communicate with eachother. (Meshtastic is GPL 3 for the record) In that case you'd only really be using the communication protocol behind Meshtastic but the actual project itself is entirely unrelated outside of the communications protocol.\n\nI'm not expecting any definite answer here but I'm just not sure generally where the line would be drawn. Especially since binary blobs and such are directly present in the linux kernel, i.e. very much non-GPL code being integral to an overall GPL project, I'm not sure what 'derivative' would really mean strictly speaking. Would the difference maker literally be who calls who; if the GPL code calls the non-GPL code that's fine but if the non-GPL code calls the GPL code then that's a derivative? I know the GPL especially has a lot of vaguity, hence things like the LGPL, but is there any general consensus on when something becomes a derivative? Going back to the Meshtastic example, (it's what made me start thinking about this since it's a very embedded-esque project and in embedded everything is far more tightly integrated) I can't imagine ***every*** device implementing Meshtastic communication has some way to change the OS, so wouldn't that be 'tivoisation' that violates the GPL v3? Or, since the makers didn't go out of their way to ***deny*** the ability to change the firmware would that not be tivoisation even if the user can't reasonably change the OS?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/18oxno3/how_do_licenses_like_the_gpl_work_with/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "OpenAI seeks new funding at 100 billion valuation", "summary": "According to Bloomberg sources, OpenAI is in early talks to raise new funding at a valuation of $100 billion or more.\n\nhttps://the-decoder.com/openai-seeks-new-funding-at-100-billion-valuation/", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDecoder/comments/18p3676/openai_seeks_new_funding_at_100_billion_valuation/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "aidebugs- a cli tool for errors!
