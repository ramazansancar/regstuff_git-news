And the thing is, I feel that Shambhavi is complete of a practice if you are seeking liberation. But that has to be coupled with an unwavering emotion or thought. Something that you have decided you will do your best to be at all times.\n\nThis has been touched by sadhguru many many times but the thing is, generally in youtube and other platforms where his free content is available, we seekers are generally not the target audience. We need something that makes us stick to being unwavering.\n\nIn inner engineering, we got a number of things that we can be unwavering about:\n1. Love\n2. Acceptance\n3. Responsibility \n4. Awareness of being not body and mind\n\nEtc. But the point is, we tend to think shambhavi is just those 40 minutes or 80 minutes of exercise. I made this mistake for few months and got lost.\n\nBut now I have decided to stick with unwavering acceptance. \n\nAm I perfect? No. But isn\u2019t it just a game :) I want to win, but if I lose, then its okay.\n\nWith that spirit in mind, I am sticking to acceptance. But I want to help or bring more awareness on this point to many who are on this path. Especially isha meditators who honestly are like siblings in one way as we all are connected via our guru.\n\nSo I am thinking of creating a discord community so that some of us who really want to make our whole life a sadhana can talk with the each other, encourage each other and share experiences. I know in this path we are all alone but hey, sometimes who knows someone can help someone else in the community to get to their ultimate nature!\n\nI get that Sadhguru usually doesn\u2019t promote intra communities(or so I have observed) and he must have his valid reasons. Hence we can stick to just this one thing and help others if need be by our own experiences.\n\nIf anyone of you are interested then you can DM me or ping me. If I see more than 10 people interested then maybe I will create a discord server or something.\n\nNamaskaram!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Sadhguru/comments/18v51c4/thinking_of_starting_a_community_of_people/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Get more out of your presentations with AI-powered annotated slides", "summary": "1/ Programmer Simon Willison describes how he creates \"annotated presentations\".
