A couple of days back I had an awakening that I should be more involved with my dieties than I am - this may sound a bit selfish on my part and you may think that \"oh now this guy has problems in his life, that he starts remembering his god\" I'm not going to lie it may be that or something I quite can't understand that. \n\nHowever, since all this has happened I wanted to see how I can be more involved with the dieties and did some googling. My nakshatra is Ardra which is ruled by Lord Rudra, my home diety is Gavigangadareshwara who is a incarnation of Lord Shiva - who's temple I have not been in more than 5 years but throught my life I have been very fond of Lord Shiva in my own way. Since now I wanted to do more I wanted to start chanting a Rudra Mantra everyday \"Aum Namo Bagawathe Rudraye\" which I learnt is a form of praise and prayer to Lord Rudra and to also chant Mahamruthunjaya Stotra as well both 108 times a day. \n\nI don't want to do anything wrong or to start some path which I don't know anything about, bottom line I have lots of problems in my life and I'm seeking a way out of it. Is chanting above shlokas without proper methods bad? How can I be more involved spiritually which can provide some solace to my problems and my feelings about not being connected to my diety. \n\nThis Post maybe long but I hope that I can find some answers.\n\nThank you..", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Sadhguru/comments/195dzz6/seeking_some_knowledge_on_mantra_spiritual_way_of/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Infinity Meditation", "summary": "There\u00b4s a YouTube video of sadhguru called 'infinity meditation'. This video was what made me intuit Sadhguru had 'something' and was legit. It was also one of the most important moments of my life. What I experienced that day can not be put into words, but I would say is not an experience, I did not experience bliss or ecstasy or even non duality, it was something else, pure dissolution, in a way that I didn\u00b4t know it was possible. My whole body dissolved into reality. Time collapsed. My body collapsed into reality with time at the same time. It was just...utter perfection. Absolute Heaven. \n\nI believe this is the highest state of being before dissolving absolutely into reality (mahasamadhi). In fact, one of the attachments I have is that I do not want to die if I can not feel that feeling when dead. In other hand, I wonder if one one dies, maybe that\u00b4s what one experiences. \n\nI try not to think much about it. After all, I am doing my sadhana and following sadhguru guidelines because I want a joyful and effortless life. I can imagine even sadhguru itself, can not put itself into this state of consciousness most of the time. It is too much. It is too good.\n\n At the other hand, is so so so pleasurable and intense, that I know is the only thing I want. How to not think about it? Or maybe I should embrace my desire about it and let it burn inside as a motivation to do my sadhana? Wouldn't that frustrate me? Should I forget and pray that when one dies that feeling is being felt constantly?

That is why I want to move to a center, I\u2019m excited for this and I think it\u2019s going to be perfect for me.

That\u2019s great, but it\u2019s only 4 days. I emailed Isha and they always just refer me to the program web page.\nMy question is do people stay for long times in the centers? how do I know what center to choose and what course(s) to take after inner engineering? and are there any long term programs in which I can do numerous courses for at least a month (or longer!!) so I can really establish a foundation?\n\nI really want to change my inner experience into a blissful and healthy one. It\u2019s time for me to take responsibility. I just want to do it right and currently have no guidance.
