I have an idea for something more complex and I'm hoping to get some direction on where to start.\n\nI'm looking to put together a small device that can determine its location (with a reasonable degree of accuracy) in a small space, like a home, and to set custom zones or boundaries. An example of this would be the Meta Quest 2's guardian feature. The Quest 2 is able to store the data of where the user established the guardian boundary in their home and remembers that location even if the device leaves the area.\n\nMy initial searches on this topic have brought me to SLAM mapping, landmark recognition, and photogrammetry. Any ideas for where I should start with this or how the Quest achieves this?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1bgdwzi/location_mapping/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Llama2 7B chat completion for TPU v3-8", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/arjondas/llama.git", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Can any of you guys do a full Padmasana(lotus pose) and if Yes how long did it take you to do it effortlessly?", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Sadhguru/comments/1bg8ycb/can_any_of_you_guys_do_a_full_padmasanalotus_pose/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "I made an open source app that uses a local Large Language Model to enable fully local interaction with documents on users' devices.", "summary": "", "link": "https://github.com/alexpinel/Dot", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The Green Rock of Hattusa Ancient City, Turkey, Corum", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1bg2pdh", "author": "None"}, {"title": "I want to track a black line on a white sheet of paper for a line-tracking car.

I just couldn't find any clear questions after scouring the net. \n\nSo essentially my goal is to count the number of pencil crayons in those old school plastic pencil boxes from grade school. However, the pencil crayons are in 2 to 3 layers so they overlap. I had initially used Yolov8 to draw bounding boxes around each of them, but I read that this might not be appropriate. Should I be segmenting out each of the pencil crayons as distinct objects and then just counting the number of unique masks SAM or some other model generates?\n\nThanks a million!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1bg82m9/novice_question_identifying_overlapping_objects/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ukrainian doctors save child who swallowed 20 magnets", "summary": "", "link": "https://unn.ua/en/news/ukrainian-doctors-save-child-who-swallowed-20-magnets", "author": "None"}, {"title": "2-Year-Old Girl and Parents Use Parachute to Survive Plane Crash with 'Minor Cuts and Scratches'", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/entertainment/2-old-girl-parents-parachute-131904309.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Running CV Detection On a Locked Down System", "summary": "CV Newbie Here.\n\nI'm trying to run real time detection on a locked down system that I cannot install or run any software on. \n\nMy initial plan is to intercept the HDMI signal (likely with a capture card) and feed it into a Linux machine that can overlay the detection boxes on any identified objects, and then re-export the HDMI feed to the monitor. \n\nLooking to see if anyone else has done something similar, what tools they have used, thoughts, and lessons learned.\n\nI have attached a photo illustrating what I am describing.

So please rectify me if I'm wrong or not clear.\n\nI'm doing a school project where I have multiple camera in a room (each vision overlap). One task of this project is to able to put one/multiples 2D point on only one of these camera and to automatically translate that point into other cameras.\n\nI was guided to the idea of making a shared 3D reference frame, with this it will somehow simple to make the task because If I can translate a point from one camera into that 3D plane, I wil be able to project back to other cameras, is that right ?\n\nI explored different things for being able to do that, the first thing was about stereo visions and disparity map, but I was told that I didn't had to use a disparity map, is that true ? And now I was thinking about only getting extrinsic parameters using [solvePnP]( with a chessboard on the floor.\n\nIf someone can give any informations for doing that task, I will be thankful.\n\nThanks in advance for your response.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1bgep1q/question_multicamera_and_2d_point_translation/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "Women\u2019s Super League game between Chelsea and Arsenal delayed due to sock snafu", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Women\u2019s Super League game between Chelsea and Arsenal delayed due to sock snafu</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDMvMTYvc3BvcnQvY2hlbHNlYS1hcnNlbmFsLXdzbC1zb2Nrcy1zcHQtaW50bC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-03-16", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Covid casts long shadow over New Zealand paddler Jones", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Covid casts long shadow over New Zealand paddler Jones</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDMvMTYvc3BvcnQvbHV1a2Etam9uZXMtbG9uZy1jb3ZpZC1uZXctemVhbGFuZC1jYW5vZS1zcHQtaW50bC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gEA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-03-16", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Lance Armstrong says that he experienced PTSD and had intensive therapy \u2013 \u2018all alone, one-on-one, 10 hours a day\u2019", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Lance Armstrong says that he experienced PTSD and had intensive therapy \u2013 \u2018all alone, one-on-one, 10 hours a day\u2019</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDMvMTYvc3BvcnQvbGFuY2UtYXJtc3Ryb25nLXB0c2QtY3ljbGluZy1kb3Bpbmctc3B0LWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBVWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjQvMDMvMTYvc3BvcnQvbGFuY2UtYXJtc3Ryb25nLXB0c2QtY3ljbGluZy1kb3Bpbmctc3B0LWludGw?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-03-16", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ex-college football star, son of Texas A&M associate head coach, arrested in poisoning deaths of girlfriend and unborn baby", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Ex-college football star, son of Texas A&amp;M associate head coach, arrested in poisoning deaths of girlfriend and unborn baby</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDMvMTYvc3BvcnQvYmxhaXNlLXRheWxvci1hcnJlc3RlZC1wcmVnbmFudC1naXJsZnJpZW5kLXBvaXNvbmluZy9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFdaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyNC8wMy8xNi9zcG9ydC9ibGFpc2UtdGF5bG9yLWFycmVzdGVkLXByZWduYW50LWdpcmxmcmllbmQtcG9pc29uaW5n?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-03-16", "author": "None"}]}}};
