I chose to create the software as a Blender add-on, rather than a stand-alone software to allow the material editing workflow merge better with the best open-source 3D editing software available.\n\n  \nMatLayer is a free and open-source libre add-on that drastically speeds up and simplifies the material editing workflow by providing a wrapper user interface for Blender's vanilla material nodes. You can use MatLayer to make optimized, professional quality materials and textures for game engines, VRChat, still renders, movies and more.  \nI've invested over 2000 hours over the past 3 years to designing, programming, researching, testing and making assets for MatLayer so there will be a great, free 3D material editing solution available, and everyone will have the freedom to create.\n\n  \nAlthough MatLayer isn't a perfect software, I've put some of my heart and soul into it and will continue to develop it (although perhaps at a slow pace) further. This is my contribution to the free and open source software community.  \nYou can read more about the add-ons features and get the latest release on the github page.\n\n  \n[https://github.com/LoganFairbairn/matlayer](https://github.com/loganfairbairn/matlayer)\n\n  \nCheers!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/199qlkc/matlayer_a_fully_featured_free_and_opensource/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "FastWave: Build UIs faster, with h2o-wave and fastapi.", "summary": "Hi, I am building **FastWave**, a python library that extends **FastAPI**'s support, to **H2O Wave**, a software stack for building beautiful, low-latency, realtime, browser-based applications and dashboards entirely in Python without using HTML, Javascript, or CSS.\n\n[https://github.com/arnavdas88/fastwave/](https://github.com/arnavdas88/fastwave/)  \n\n\n&gt;It is still in very early development phase, and lacks a lot of documentation, but still can be used in some lesser complex projects.\n\nAny feedback on the code/documentation/issues/README/architecture/etc is appreciated.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/19a01fd/fastwave_build_uis_faster_with_h2owave_and_fastapi/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "Aleksander Aamodt Kilde recalls horror crash that resulted in emergency surgery", "summary": "Aleksander Aamodt Kilde recalls horror crash that resulted in emergency surgery&nbsp;&nbsp;", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDEvMTgvc3BvcnQvYWxla3NhbmRlci1hYW1vZHQta2lsZGUtcmVjYWxscy1ob3Jyb3ItY3Jhc2gtc3B0LWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-01-18", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Canadian world champion pole vaulter Shawn Barber dies at 29", "summary": "Canadian world champion pole vaulter Shawn Barber dies at 29&nbsp;&nbsp;", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDEvMTgvc3BvcnQvc2hhd24tYmFyYmVyLWRlYXRoLXBvbGUtdmF1bHQvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBUWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjQvMDEvMTgvc3BvcnQvc2hhd24tYmFyYmVyLWRlYXRoLXBvbGUtdmF1bHQvaW5kZXguaHRtbA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-01-19", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How the Rolling Stones inspired Iga \u015awi\u0105tek to comeback win at the Australian Open", "summary": "How the Rolling Stones inspired Iga \u015awi\u0105tek to comeback win at the Australian Open&nbsp;&nbsp;", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDEvMTgvc3BvcnQvaWdhLXN3aWF0ZWstcm9sbGluZy1zdG9uZXMtYXVzdHJhbGlhbi1vcGVuLWRhbmllbGxlLWNvbGxpbnMtc3B0LWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-01-18", "author": "None"}, {"title": "NBA player Josh Giddey won\u2019t face charges following investigation into alleged relationship with a minor", "summary": "NBA player Josh Giddey won\u2019t face charges following investigation into alleged relationship with a minor&nbsp;&nbsp;", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDEvMTcvc3BvcnQvbmJhLXRodW5kZXItam9zaC1naWRkZXktcmVwb3J0LW5vLWNoYXJnZXMtc3B0LWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBZmh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjQvMDEvMTcvc3BvcnQvbmJhLXRodW5kZXItam9zaC1naWRkZXktcmVwb3J0LW5vLWNoYXJnZXMtc3B0LWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-01-18", "author": "None"}]}}};
