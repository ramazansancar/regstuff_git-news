Then sometimes do typos, they put spaces where they shouldn't (12000HS becomes 12000-HS\" for example). Sometimes they type-in references that don't even exist (for this one, can't do that much). They also sometimes give only approximate info, e.g. \"Intel Core i5 11th Gen\" which could be like 5 different CPUs.\n\nThe way I am doing it now is simply cleaning up the text, and then making regexes to try to match as many CPUs as I can, but since there are thousands of components, I can't possibly write them all, let alone take into account the typos.\n\nThat's why I'm asking here for more advanced techniques that could achieve what I can. You have to know that CPU/GPU references can be really close to each other in Levenstein distance, but have really different capabilities.\n\nI have tried using a powerful LLM (ChatGPT 3.5), and unsurprisingly it works very well, and is able to find the CPU in the postings even if it's not clear.

I have no formal computational experience. I self studied Python on Coursera and acquired two certificates in the PY4E specialisation (2022).\n\n3. I used to work to develop a virtual assistant but not as a computational linguist. I did localisation but also still had to work around the Terminal, run some provided scripts, amend the codes minimally (following the guidelines only) (2019). So I studied Python only after leaving the job above.\n\n4. Now I wanted to become someone who specialises in developing things like virtual assistants, language model, etc. but I\u2019m not sure what modules to look for to gain the necessary skills.\n\n5. I often see job listings which look for computer scientists/computer engineers/AI specialists for things I want to do. So will I actually learn how to do language modelling, building the algorithm, develop language learning models?\n\n6. I am planning to pursue an MSc, and have secured offers for both Manchester (unconditional) and Edinburgh (conditional: IELTS) but wonder which one is better for me.\n\nADDITIONAL INFO:\nModules offered by\n\n-- the University of Edinburgh\u2014\n\nCORE:  Computer Programming for Speech and Language Processing | Accelerated Natural Language Processing | Speech Processing | Statistics and Quantitative Methods | Research Ethics Training in Linguistics and English Language\n\nOPTION: NLU, Generation, MT | ASR | Speech Synthesis | ML in Signal Processing | Simulating Language | Phonetics and Laboratory Phonology | Speech Production &amp; Perception | Working with Users\n\n\u2014 University of Manchester \u2014\n\nCORE: Computational Linguistics 1 | Computational Linguistics 2 | Foundational Statistics | Corpus Linguistics | Research Methods in CCL 1 | Research Methods in CCL 2\n\nI\u2019m not sure what their option modules are (unavailable).", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1bdko99/which_program_would_equip_me_with_the_skills_to/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Looking for a cli-app (standalone binary, dependency-free) that allows you to connect to a VPN (like Proton)", "summary": "Something like [vopono](\n\nI want to connect the whole system and not a single application.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/1bdscqo/looking_for_a_cliapp_standalone_binary/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Yolov8 can't read rtsp camera feed", "summary": "I need help trying to understand what I'm doing wrong. I started a project with 2 old security cameras (2012 chinese generic cameras) and got everything working just fine. Did an object detection show the feed on my screen with the boxes selecting the classes.\n\nThen I upgraded those cameras for 3 brand new 1080p rtsp cameras (again generic chinese yoosee compatible cameras)\n\nThe old camera feed is located in a url like this  [ \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nthe new ones use rtsp so another format url something like this  \n\n    rtsp://admin:admin@192.168.15.6:554/onvif1\n\nmy code is pretty standard and a user of yolo github suggested me few changes  and fixes. Right now code looks like this:\n\n from ultralytics import YOLO \n\n# Load the model \n\nmodel = YOLO(\"yolov8n.pt\")  \n\n# Create a generator for the RTSP feed \n\nresults = model.predict(source='rtsp://admin:admin @alex-gpt.168.15.6:554/onvif1', stream=True) \n\n # Iterate over the generator to process and display each frame \n\nfor result in results:     \n\nresult.show()  # Display the frame with detections \n\nit just cant read the feed. Results comes back empty and doesnt get in the loop. i get this when I print results  &lt;generator object BasePredictor.stream\\_inference at 0x000001BEDC5D8BA0&gt; \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThis is my camera (sorry no english just portuguese link) [ \n\nRegular ipcamera with rtsp h264 compression (guessing from what I saw over aliexpress similar camera).\n\nRTSP is working I can open that url on VLC and see the feed just cant connect from yolo or openCV using ffmpeg.\n\nI need some help figuring out what is wrong. If I'm doing something wrong that can be fixed or if the camera is not compatible and I should look for other camera ( suggestions on specs would be nice as I will have to research on cameras available in my country.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThx so much for your help guys.
