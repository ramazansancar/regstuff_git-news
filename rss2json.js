For example, say the document is about practical steps for how to take care of the pooping habits of common pets, and I search \u201cdog\u201d or \u201ccanine\u201d. I\u2019d like to get all sections of the text (there could be multiple) related to this discussion for dogs. Note that the text is fundamentally about taking care of animals pooping, not about animals themselves, so there could be parts of text relevant for dogs without the direct mention of them (likely around the sections where there *is* direct mention of them, but not always). Also note that by searching canine, I\u2019d like to more or less get the same return as searching dog, even though the term is less commonly used. This second problem seems not nearly as hard, given both terms have very similar semantic meaning. The first is trickier given the model must understand relations and properties of the searches entity. \n\nAnother example could be searching for \u201cDonald Trump\u201d in a news article about recent developments in republican candidates\u2019 campaigns and how the party currently fairs against the democrats. It would be nice to get all discussions of Trump but also segments about how republicans are doing versus democrats since this is relevant for Trump. \n\nWhat is this problem called exactly?

I've always wished that the incentives were better for maintainers so I could justify more time there, but they just aren't.  It's crazy to me how little FOSS maintainers are compensated even for projects that are critical for our industry.\n\nIt occurred to me that one approach that might help might be:  Instead of just using MIT license for everything, publish projects with a dual license - one for pure open source and another for commercial that just requires _any_ payment amount.  So something like a dual license of GPL and also a modified version of MIT (where one penny or more needs to be paid to enable).\n\nI know that some projects have gone this direction of dual license with GPL (eg. MySQL, Qt) but the commercial use side of the license is way more complex than I would want.  I think just _any_ amount would be best and would encourage users to donate more if they want to help support it.\n\nAs far as I know, there isn't a modified MIT license like this that exists, so would need to be created.  I also expect that there would be obvious exploits like pay one penny and then re-release it with a more normal single MIT license, but that seems totally fine to me for my purposes.\n\nSo I'm looking for feedback from people that have thought about this problem more to tell me why this is a bad idea or why it wouldn't actually work in practice?\n\nEdit: changed wording from donation to payment", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1anb3s5/mit_license_except_with_a_donation_requirement/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Adiyogi Bangalore", "summary": "Plan your visit to Adiyogi Shiva in Bangalore with our comprehensive visitor guide.
