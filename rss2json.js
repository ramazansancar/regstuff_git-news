Our church hosts a couple of camps/conferences where we require registration (release form, contact information, medical information) plus occasionally payment.  \n\n\nRight now we're using a wordpress plugin that we use through our wordpress site called Event Espresso. The tool is a little unwieldy and some of our event coordinators have opted to just stop using it and use a simple excel sheet instead. The nice thing is it does integrate pretty well with a credit card payment system, which makes keeping track of event payments pretty easy. We're paying several hundred per year for the sub.\n\nI have some programming experience, so I was thinking of throwing together my own little registration tool, but I'm just a little unsure of integrating payments into it and was hoping there is an option out there that's comparable in price (or cheaper) to what we're paying for event espresso, but easier to use.

Continuously pushing the boundaries of AIGC,  numerous striking new tasks have been proposed. Previous conventional tasks have started to intermingle and merge, with their boundaries becoming increasingly blurry. Moreover, contemporary papers often engage in a variety of related tasks, creating a dazzling display of their capabilities. Alongside this trend, the nomenclature of these tasks has become more confusing and ambiguous. Over the past two years, our lab has focused on image composition. However, **we have recently observed a convergence between image composition, image inpainting, and image customization. These three tasks all involve the combination of foreground and background,** as illustrated in the figure below, showcasing both intersections and distinctions.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s5dk34dgvwbc1.png?width=2345&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cfb781550304d9fc7c6f7d46143ef86876fd744c\n\nConsidering the combination of foreground and background, we assume that the foreground and background can be of two modalities: text and images. Therefore, there are four possible combinations, as shown in the table below. **If both the foreground and background are text**, it essentially describes the entire image in a single sentence, which is standard text-to-image generation task. **If the foreground is text and the background is an image**, the goal is to generate a foreground that conforms to the text description on a specified or reasonable region of the background image. This task is called text-guided inpainting or text-guided composition. **If both the foreground and background are images**, the objective is to generate a foreground object in a specified or reasonable region on the background image that resembles the appearance of the foreground image. This task is called object-guided inpainting or object-guided composition, which is also considered within the scope of image customization. **If the foreground is an image and the background is text**, it refers to the early concept of image customization.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x8mpfszhvwbc1.png?width=2548&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c63d1afa41e0ace7926858cffd669abb3906c52d\n\nLet's summarize from the perspective of tasks. Regarding **image inpainting**, the areas to be filled can be guided by the image of the foreground object or its textual description, or can be filled without any guidance. Regarding **image composition**, the inserted foreground object can be in the form of an image or text. Our lab previously focused on merging foreground object images into background images, breaking down image composition into several subtasks \\[[https://github.com/bcmi/Awesome-Image-Composition](https://github.com/bcmi/Awesome-Image-Composition)\\]. These subtasks involve adjusting the boundary, illumination, shadows, viewpoint, and pose of the foreground object separately, or predicting a reasonable placement area for the foreground object. In the past two years, generative composition, as  a branch of image composition, intersects with image inpainting/customization, where foreground objects are generated in specified regions. Generative composition re-creates foreground objects, allowing for comprehensive adjustments, but there is still significant room for improvement in terms of controllability, stability, and fidelity. We have integrated related functionalities of image composition, including generative composition, into the libcom toolbox \\[[https://github.com/bcmi/libcom](https://github.com/bcmi/libcom)\\]. Regarding **image customization**, foreground objects can consist of single or multiple images. The foreground objects can be merged into an image or text background. Since it involves generating or editing images around a given foreground object, it is also referred to as subject-driven image generation/editing. In a broader sense, any operation performed on a given foreground object can be deemed as image customization. It is worth noting that a foreground object with multiple images is not exclusive to image customization; the general object-guided inpainting and generative composition can also utilize multiple images of the same foreground object.\n\nNext, let's further narrow down the scope, **considering only cases where both foreground and background are images**. For **object-guided inpainting**, it is necessary to specify the filling area, which can take any shape. The shape of the filling area will also affect the shape of the filled object, as illustrated in the examples of a square and an elliptical filling area in the figure below. For **generative composition**, current approaches typically involve specifying a bounding box to place the foreground object. The background information within the bounding box is expected to be preserved, such as the tree leaves in the bounding box. Subsequent works may remove the constraints of the bounding box or indicate the placement area of the foreground object in other ways. For **image customization**, given multiple images of a foreground object, the task is to integrate the foreground object into the background image. Whether it's object-guided inpainting, generative composition, or image customization, future works may introduce various control information for the foreground object.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dzvd8hkjvwbc1.jpg?width=2518&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=39728c73f07da5b91e6602dc901c342a2adaa6fd\n\nThe above is my attempt to clarify the relationships between the three tasks: composition, inpainting, and customization. It may seem a bit complex as these three research directions have evolved along their own timelines and are still evolving rapidly. If there are any omissions, I will promptly make corrections.
