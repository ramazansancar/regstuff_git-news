I took around 4 to 5 online courses on image processing, computer vision, 3D computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning. I also read three books about computer vision: \"Multiple View Geometry,\" \"Computer Vision: Models, Learning, and Inference,\" and \"Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications.\" Plus, I've read lots of papers related to my previous position over these 5 years.\n\nNow, I'm looking for a new 3D computer vision position, and I found out that many positions require a \"publication track record,\" which I don't have. I have an MS degree but didn't publish any papers. My master's thesis was about embedded systems and sensor fusion, not directly related to computer vision. The problem is, I really want to continue working in computer vision, especially 3D. What should I do? I mean I'm not aiming for top-notch, famous companies like OpenAI, Google Brain, or Nvidia. I know that's beyond my league. But even small to medium-sized companies are asking for this publication track record. Am I doomed?\n\nI can think of two ways to earn my \"reputation,\" but I'm not sure if recruiters or HR would care about it.\n\n* Do a side project. I'm already working on it, but to be honest, compared to the cool vision stuff we often see on LinkedIn, my project kind of feels like a toy.\n* Do Kaggle. Do recruiters, HRs or companies care about this?\n\nI will appreciate if anyone of you could give me advice on what my next \"endeavors\" should be. What would you do if you were me? If you were hiring computer vision engineers, what would make me stand out if I don't have any publication track record.
