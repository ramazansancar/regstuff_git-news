This involves lots of HTML parsing to structured data and adding model fields to a article classification. Example heuristics:\n\n  \n\n\nPerson \u2014&gt; Occupation label, or political office. Also if they are alive or deceased. Also if they are a real of \"virtual\" person (character in TV, Movie, Book etc)\n\n  \n\n\nMusic \u2014&gt; Band or instrument or theory. If album or single or video.\n\n  \n\n\nTV/Movies \u2014&gt; Cast, Production, Years, series/episodes\n\n  \n\n\nSport \u2014&gt; Individual or team members. Location. Competitions, Accolades.\n\n  \n\n\nWar \u2014&gt; Years and location. Participants\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nPhase 3 - Gather missed articles that weren't labeled correctly\n\n  \n\n\nUse weak unsupervised learning, to find articles that were mislabelled in step 1 and 2 and add their meta data to the classification.\n\n  \n\n\nThere are a number of existing article classification systems for Wikipedia that used different methods and different sources of data to infer article labels. Some are better classifications than others, I'm hoping to use an ensemble approach to combine these into a unified classification system using weak learning tricks.\n\n  \n\n\nPhase 4 - Create a Knowledge Graph using article NER triples\n\n  \n\n\nOnce I have a document classification system, I'll focus on build an graph of in document \"knowledge\". I'll combine structured data from infoboxes, section headings, lists, table and citations to create some high-level KG tuples.\n\n  \n\n\nThen use link text and NER parser to build low-level tuples for the Knowledge Graph.\n\n  \n\n\nMy hope here is to decompose full articles into chunks, like sections and paragraphs. So eventually we can build a search tool that is not dependent on article titles alone.\n\n  \n\n\nPhase 5 - Improve KG connections and weight/score links based on Page View\n\n  \n\n\nCombine Page View statistics and internal HTTP links to other articles, to make more connects on the Knowledge Graph and weigh them based on user page views. This weighted graph should help rank results much the same way PageRank used to work in the early days of Google.\n\n  \n\n\nPhase 6 - Score articles based on their Citations and Refereneces\n\n  \n\n\nWikipedia articles should be well cited.
