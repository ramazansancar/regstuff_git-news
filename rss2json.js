What kind of ridiculous statement is that?  I can acknowledge that my body is made up of the food I ate, that my emotions are fleeting, and that my psychological content is gathered from my experience. And I also know that the consciousness that is experiencing my body, emotions, surroundings, thoughts etc. is me, I get it. But that does not change the fact that I need my body, emotions and thoughts on a daily basis so I can survive, and help the people in my life. And the goal to be blissed out every second of your life is so dumb. Life can be very hard and painful, and I don't care how much you meditate or read scriptures, you will always be vulnerable, and be exposed to pain. I think his advice can be so unaplicable to life. Just because he started meditating from an very early age on, and for some reason has had many mystical experiences, doesn't mean that everyone can be blissed out all the time like he apparently is. \nIf someone disagrees and has something to add, then I would appreciate a comment.
