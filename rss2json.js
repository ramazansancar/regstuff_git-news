Please clean it out!&quot;, and either I do it because its mine or explain to her it's not mine. She's also made statements like &quot;I feel like some people do more than others&quot; and I have no clue how to respond.\nOf course I want to live in a clean place. But I find the way she is approaching this to be very stressful. It's like she phrases her complaints as a personal attack. We don't have any cleaning system/schedule but each time I try to put one together it falls apart. For example dirty dishes may end up in the sink because no one is emptying the dishwasher. But then some people say they don't use the dishwasher.\nHow can I get it so we're not always fighting about cleaning? I really don't like how when I walk by her she unloads a laundry list of complaints, should I tell her to schedule a meeting?
