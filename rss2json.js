Emerging evidence, including 23,000-year-old human footprints in New Mexico, hints at an earlier arrival than previously thought.\n\nWhile the conventional theory proposes an ice-free corridor opening 13,000 years ago, the new perspective suggests that early Americans might have navigated along the Pacific coastline from Beringia, a land bridge formed during the last glacial maximum. This hypothesis gains support from archaeological finds, including coastal settlements in western Canada dating back 14,000 years.\n\nThe \"kelp highway\" theory had previously been considered, proposing a gradual southward boat journey. However, challenges arose in 2020 when researchers suggested that glacial freshwater created strong currents, complicating coastal travel. In response, researchers, including Summer Praetorius of the US Geological Survey, delved into paleoclimate reconstructions of the Pacific Northwest.\n\nExamining ocean sediment proxies, the team uncovered data from tiny, fossilized plankton, offering insights into past ocean conditions. Their findings, presented at the American Geophysical Union Annual Meeting, propose that a \"sea ice highway\" could have been utilized between 24,500-22,000 years ago and 16,400-14,800 years ago.\n\nDuring the last glacial maximum, ocean currents were twice as strong due to glacial winds and lower sea levels, posing challenges for boat travel. However, the presence of winter sea ice until around 15,000 years ago opens the possibility that early Americans, adept at cold climates, used the sea ice as a platform for migration and hunting marine mammals.\n\nWhile proving this theory faces challenges with most archaeological sites underwater, it offers a fresh perspective on how ancient humans might have reached North America without a land bridge or easy ocean travel. Praetorius emphasizes that the sea ice highway doesn't rule out other migration routes, and the Alaskan current calming down by 14,000 years ago suggests diverse human ingenuity in ancient migration.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Archaeology/comments/18s53jl/unveiling_the_ancient_sea_ice_highway_a/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Scientists destroy 99% of cancer cells in the lab using vibrating molecules", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-destroy-99-of-cancer-cells-in-the-lab-using-vibrating-molecules", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Computer Vision for Pesticide Sprayer", "summary": "Hello everyone, I am kind of a newbie when it comes to computer vision.
