From what I have gathered so far, these should be token\\_id's after a first tokenization step. However I am a bit confused about how the dimensionality works out here. The embedding matrix **W\\_e** should be a matrix of dimensionality **N x H** , where N is the total number of all possible token ids of that tokenizer, and H is the dimension of the hidden layer in the transformer blocks. So basically **W\\_e** is a lookup table where every row corresponds to the embedding of that token id. The way that **W\\_e** should work is that you take a one-hot encoded representation of a token id and multiply it to select the appropriate row.\r  \n\r  \nSo I am a bit confused about how this multiplication works in the paper. The way that I understand it for it to work out the matrix U should contain every token\\_id as a one-hot encoded row. In other words the matrix should look like this:\r  \n\r  \n**first row = U\\_{1,:} = \\[ 0 , 0 , ... 1 , 0 , 0 ...\\]**\r  \n\r  \n**second row = U\\_{2,:} = \\[ 0 , 1 ,0 , .. 0 \\]**\r  \n\r  \netc. Where the column index of the 1 corresponds to the value of the token id of that token.\r  \n\r  \nIs this correct? Then I feel like it's a bit unclear in the paper. They just write **U= (u1, u2, ...)** and that's all. Can someone confirm that this if my understanding is correct?\r  \n\r  \n**Question 2: Where does this step happen in the HuggingFace model?**\r  \n\r  \nSo assuming the previous interpretation is correct, I tried calling the model in HuggingFace. Consider the following snippet:\n\n    \r\nfrom transformers import OpenAIGPTTokenizer, OpenAIGPTModel\r\nimport torch\r\ntokenizer = OpenAIGPTTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"openai-gpt\")\r\nmodel = OpenAIGPTModel.from_pretrained(\"openai-gpt\")\r\ninputs = tokenizer(\"Hello, my dog is cute\", return_tensors=\"pt\")\r\nprint(f\"inputs: {inputs}\")\r\noutputs =model(**inputs)\r\nprint(f\"outputs: {outputs}\")\r\n\r\nRETURNS:\n    \r\ninputs: {'input_ids': tensor([[3570,  240,  547, 2585,  544, 4957]]), 'attention_mask': tensor([[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]])}\r\noutputs: BaseModelOutput(last_hidden_state=tensor([[[ 0.4653,  0.0642,  0.5910,  ...,  0.1177, -0.0021, -1.2262],\r\n         [-0.3697, -0.0957,  0.6613,  ..., -0.0344, -0.2164,  0.1205],\r\n         [ 0.1700, -0.3252,  0.0407,  ...,  0.1589, -0.8057, -0.2830],\r\n         [-0.3669, -0.0448,  0.8061,  ..., -0.0090, -0.0872, -0.5224],\r\n         [-0.5047,  0.6522,  0.6932,  ...,  0.0811,  0.6475,  0.3190],\r\n         [-0.2972,  0.0591,  1.2333,  ..., -0.7394, -0.2600,  0.0863]]],\r\n       grad_fn=&lt;ViewBackward0&gt;), hidden_states=None, attentions=None)\n\n\r  \nSo it seems here that the actual input to the model is just a single tensor of token ids tensor(\\[\\[3570, 240, 547, 2585, 544, 4957\\]\\]) that has not been put in an appropriate one-hot encoded form U. Can anyone confirm if that is happening internally in the model first before it is multiplied by the embedding matrix?\r  \n\r  \n**Question 3: What to do with the output of this \"last\\_hidden\\_state\"?**\r  \n\r  \nSo the way that I understand it, the output here is literally the output of the last transformer block \"h\\_n\". It has dimension (1, 6 , 768) -- so basically for each input token I get the hidden final state of length 768.\r  \n\r  \nSo how to use this result now if I want to do something with it? There is not much I can do with this final state without training a separate classifier.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1ad03bx/questions_about_gpt1_in_huggingface/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "A Practical Guide to GNU sed With Examples", "summary": "Hello and happy new year!\n\nI published  yesterday [a guide about the CLI GNU sed]( It's really useful to edit automatically some plain text files, in a Bash script for example. It's not that complicated to use either.\n\nA tl;dr:\n\n* The sed command-line can take two arguments: a sed script and a file.\n* Instead of a file, an input can also be piped to sed.\n* A sed script is composed of three parts: the address, the command, and possibly the command's options.\n* By default, sed copy the input, edit it, and output the result. It means that the input itself is never modified.\n* If you modify directly the file given to sed, you can't undo the editing. As a result, create a backup if you modify the file in place.\n* Adding an address in a sed script allows you to output specific lines.\n* An address can target some line numbers, or lines matching some regexes.\n* It's possible to use more than one sed script by shell command, using the option -e (or --expression).\n* The substitute command is one of the most useful commands to find and replace some text.\n* The substitute command can take some options, separated by non-alphanumerical characters: a pattern, a replacement, and optional flags.\n* With the substitute command, you can target the exact match you want to replace using flags.\n* It's possible to re-use part of the pattern in your replacement in your substitute command.\n\nHope you like it!
