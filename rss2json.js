Do you think Sri M's remarks are genuinely directed at Sadhguru, or are they more generalized critiques? How do you perceive the relationship between spiritual leaders when they seem to indirectly address each other?\n\nFurthermore, Sri M claims to have had remarkable experiences in his past lives, including being one of Krishna's Gopis, meeting Buddha and Mahavir, being a disciple of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and Sadashiva Brahmendra, and even meditating with Mahavatar Babaji centuries ago. It seems all these masters had no other job but to keep meeting him every lifetime and still he is taking rebirths one after another.
