We also witnessed users using the nightly version at a large scale (hundreds of nodes, hundreds of terabytes of data daily ingested) with minimal hardware and enjoyed lovely cost reductions.\n\nRegarding use cases, Quickwit is a great fit for logs, traces, security data, or any append-only datasets (and soon metrics). We store all the index data on an object storage. Because storage is separated from compute, it is much easier to remove or add nodes.\n\nBut you may wonder: \"bummer, now I need to have my object storage\". Fortunately, you have at least two good options in the OSS world: you can use a classic local disk if you don't care about losing your data (if original data is saved elsewhere, for example), OR you can use [Garage](https://garagehq.deuxfleurs.fr/), an OSS distributed object storage tailored for self-hosting. We had excellent feedback from users deploying it. **OSS for the win!**\n\nWe are still a small company, and any feedback is always appreciated!\n\nGithub repo - https://github.com/quickwit-oss/quickwit\n\nFun fact - some smart engineers working on petabytes of data sent us some nice pictures of their garage plenty of old servers and disks.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/193auyb/quickwit_oss_alternative_to_elasticsearchdatadog/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "If Unix Command names were supposed to have as few characters as needed, then why wasn't find named \"fd\"?", "summary": "Unix commands have names only a few characters long like rm cp mv ls, I  wonder if the devs of Unix had thought of naming find \"fd\".", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/193lfxh/if_unix_command_names_were_supposed_to_have_as/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "Dutch soccer Marc Overmans given global ban from football for ...", "summary": "Dutch soccer Marc Overmans given global ban from football for ...&nbsp;&nbsp;", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDEvMTAvc3BvcnQvbWFyYy1vdmVybWFycy1nbG9iYWwtYmFuLWZvb3RiYWxsLWludGwtc3B0L2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAQA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-01-10", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Tiger Woods and Nike\u2019s \u2018seismic\u2019 partnership is over.
