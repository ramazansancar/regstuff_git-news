I was going through an extreme low phase in 2022, when one random podcast with Sadhguru talking just came to me. I was drowning and Sadhguru came to me as a breathe of fresh air. Right after that, a series of positive events happened, I ended up moving to mysore (not planned, it just happened). It was like some divine energy is taking me forward. \n\nI got super excited when I figured that Sadhguru grew up in mysore, it just felt like something magical was happening. \n\nI began watching more of his videos, making changes to my life, I started waking up earlier, taking cold showers, meditating in the mornings (chit Shakti meditations I found on the app). It had a general positive effect on my life. I was able to handle stress way better, life became beautiful. \n\nI did the inner engineering program in 2 parts, first the 6 courses and then after a few months Shambhavi. But by the time I was doing Shambhavi, I had kinda started on a downward slope. The meditation in the morning felt like something I had to do, it became a crutch. If some day I missed it, I got worried and wondered if my anxiety will come back. I started getting angry at myself for not being able to wake up. \nI thought Shambhavi will help me bring the flow back. But it didn\u2019t. It felt so hard to do it during the initiation also. I decided that it\u2019s not good to do something as beautiful as Shambhavi by forcing myself. My mind was getting calmer and calmer by the day earlier , but then it started going in the opposite direction. I can\u2019t really pinpoint when it started going down. \n\nOver the last couple of months, I\u2019ve been seeing myself get worse and worse, until yesterday I broke down, my therapist told me to take a 2 week break from work and any responsibilities. \n\nI found Sadhguru\u2019s book karma on 1st Jan 2024, and have been reading it since. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s working or not, but I\u2019m determined to use the break to bring back the flow. \n\nI\u2019ve been trying to meditate but it\u2019s been a struggle, like there is a physical reaction in my body whenever I try to sit still and get up in a jerk. I can physically feel anger and frustration in my body. I sometimes scream and feel like throwing things. I sometimes cry randomly and break down. Other times, I\u2019m numb and just read. \n\nI\u2019m normally a very joyful person, I smile a lot, a love to cycle, explore, discover new things, do a lot of activity. This is hard because I can\u2019t seem to do any of that. \n\nAny suggestions on something I can try?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Sadhguru/comments/19diwkh/what_next/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Scientists have hailed a potentially \u2018revolutionary\u2019 breakthrough in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s, after a team of Swedish researchers found that a commercially available blood test can detect biological markers of the disease about ten to 15 years before symptoms develop.", "summary": "", "link": "https://circledseven.com/index.php/science-technology/scientists-make-alzheimers-breakthrough", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Inner engineering Insights videos not playing", "summary": "There are inner engineering Insights videos in the wisdom section of the app. They're not playing for me.
