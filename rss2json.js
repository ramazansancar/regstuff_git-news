Self-hosting provides control over the model's architecture and weights, allows customization, and ensures stability and independence from external changes. Moreover, self-hosting can lead to valuable experience in navigating the fast-evolving landscape of language models.\n      Marble also emphasizes that self-hosting allows for deep access to the models and code, enabling more flexible experimentation, optimization, and advanced techniques that are not possible with API-based models. He concludes that for companies integrating LLMs into their products or tools, self-hosting can result in better adaptability to technological evolution and a deeper understanding of the model's capabilities.\n  \n\n\n\n  Full article: Why host your own LLM?\n\n\n---\nPS: Emergent Mind is for sale.", "link": "https://www.emergentmind.com/posts/why-host-your-own-llm", "published_js": "2023-08-15", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How continuous batching enables 23x throughput in LLM inference while reducing p50 latency", "summary": "Summary:\n  \n      This article discusses how continuous batching can increase the throughput of large language model (LLM) inference by 23 times while reducing latency.
