Here's the github link if you're interested: \n\nIt only has some basic functionality so far, such as dragging clips and drag-copying clips, moving clips between tracks, etc. with support for images and video clips (but no audio yet) using FFmpeg as a decoder. It also supports exporting videos using FFmpeg again as an encoder. The rendering engine uses SkiaSharp\n\nWould love to know what you guys think of it and if you have any feedback/criticism :D.
