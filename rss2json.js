Quantitative methods taught R and basic data analysis. However, I've now forgotten a lot of this since I haven't had to use the skills from that module anywhere else, plus the teaching was quite poor. The other was a computational linguistics module. Rather than teaching us how to use Python, it showed us what the code looks like for different systems and taught us the theory behind ML, sentiment analysis, machine translation, etc. There was never any implementation of Python in our coursework or exams.\n\nSo while I understand some of the theory behind common language processing systems, I don't have a good understanding of how to programme or have a good grasp of the math to conduct rigorous statistical or data analysis. The only other experience I've gained was from a short Python &amp; App development course I did over Christmas and from using Latex for my assignments.\n\nWhat topics would you recommend I learn over the Summer so I can feel prepared to do these masters courses?
