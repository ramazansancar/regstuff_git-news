To this end, we present Foundation Model Embedded Gaussian Splatting (**FMGS**), which incorporates vision-language embeddings of  foundation models into 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS). The key contribution  of this work is an efficient method to reconstruct and represent 3D  vision-language models. This is achieved by distilling feature maps  generated from image-based foundation models into those rendered from  our 3D model. To ensure high-quality rendering and fast training, we  introduce a novel scene representation by integrating strengths from  both GS and multi-resolution hash encodings (MHE). Our effective  training procedure also introduces a pixel alignment loss that makes the  rendered feature distance of same semantic entities close, following  the pixel-level semantic boundaries. Our results demonstrate remarkable  multi-view semantic consistency, facilitating diverse downstream tasks,  beating state-of-the-art methods by **10.2** percent on open-vocabulary language-based object detection, despite that we are **851\u00d7** faster for inference. This research explores the intersection of  vision, language, and 3D scene representation, paving the way for  enhanced scene understanding in uncontrolled real-world environments.

For example, I have labelled Keitt and Madame francique type mangoes. I then trained a model from this annotated data, wrote a lambda function and then created an API. My goal is to use this model to detect, count and organise the mangoes as they pass through a conveyor belt. The mangoes are to be detected by an Oak-d camera, as they pass through a conveyor belt,  which it would then send the data to a Jetson nano for processing. The oak-d would be connected to the Jetson using ethernet.  I am not a computer vision expert so I am not sure how to go about implementing the code. Can you be of assistance? \n\n&amp;#x200B;", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/191izqq/computer_vision_assistance/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Hiding files inside images", "summary": "Hey everyone!
