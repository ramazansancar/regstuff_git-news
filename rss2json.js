The goal is to build a validated Top2Vec model capable of operating in production on a Kafka infrastructure. I am focusing on a fixed argument, particularly on a (rather small) dataset of conversations whose topics are often not precisely specified. For this reason, my supervisor suggested following a specific path.\n\nOne of the main challenges of Top2Vec (as well as Topic Modeling in general) is validating the results of the clusters obtained. Besides the various techniques that one can employ to evaluate cluster quality (i.e., Coherence Metrics, Perplexity), human evaluation is often regarded as the best technique, albeit the most time-consuming one. Therefore, relying solely on these metrics is insufficient to train a reliable model.\n\nMy supervisor suggested using a second model (I chose LDA mainly for hardware constraints) and considering it as the **ground truth** (see [Evaluation of Clustering, a Stanford lecture](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/evaluation-of-clustering-1.html)), **once optimized**. Theoretically, a \"good\" Top2Vec model would then form clusters as similar as possible to LDA ones. However, my supervisor didn't explain much further, as he obviously wanted me to put effort into finding the best solution.\n\nHere's the approach that I chose, but I am unsure if it is 100% correct:\n\n1. Train-Test Split\n2. Preprocessing\n3. Performed Nested Cross-Validation on the Training Set to find the optimal LDA model within a given parameter space. I examined the topics formed and ensured that those *K* topics actually made sense.\n4. I trained the Top2Vec Model and performed Hierarchical Reduction to obtain *K* topics exactly.\n5. I checked whether LDA assignments on the test set were equal to those of Top2Vec on the same test set.\n6. Computed evaluation cluster metrics such as Adjusted RAND, Purity, and NMI.\n\nA few doubts here:\n\n1. Even though the results wouldn't change that much, perhaps I should perform evaluation on the training set instead of the test set? So to leave the test set for production purposes only and see how Top2Vec behaves on new data?\n2. Is it incorrect to set a fixed number of Top2Vec topics (equal to the number of ground truth labels, i.e., LDA ones) instead of letting Top2Vec determine its own number of topics? It's worth noting that the metrics also function in cases where there is a discrepancy between the number of ground truth labels (LDA) and cluster labels (Top2Vec). Personally, I don't believe there would be any significant difference since clusters are only gathered after the normal algorithm runs, and there's no a priori determination of cluster size.\n\nThanks for helping!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/18mr63z/evaluation_of_clustering_in_topic_modeling_is_my/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Puck - Open-source visual editor for React.

While Loki and Prometheus share the concept of labels, the application is quite different. If you\u2019re properly using labels in Loki, you shouldn\u2019t have any cardinality problems.  \nSo, to reiterate, good labels have these qualities:  \nDescribe infrastructure: regions, clusters, servers, applications, namespaces, environments  \nHave long lived values. Label values should generate logs perpetually, or at least for several hours  \nAre intuitive for querying  \nOnly extract content from log lines if you have a query pattern that will directly benefit from a small number of additional label-value pairs, and the labels will meet these criteria:  \nIt\u2019s low cardinality, maybe tens or hundreds of values  \nAs a general rule you should try to keep any single tenant in Loki to less than 100,000 active streams, and less than a million streams in a 24-hour period.  These values are for HUGE tenants, sending more than 10 TB a day. If your tenant is 10x smaller, you should probably have at least 10x less labels.  \nThe values are long lived (e.g., the first level of an HTTP path: /load, /save, /update)  \nDo not extract ephemeral values like a trace ID or an order ID into a label, the values should be static, not dynamic.  \nYour users will use these labels in their queries to improve query performance.  \nDon\u2019t increase the size of the index and fragment your log streams if nobody is actually using these labels. If nobody uses them, you\u2019ve made things worse.\n\n&amp;#x200B;", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/18n60j3/the_concise_guide_to_grafana_loki_everything_you/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Runway launches two new video AI features and a \"general world model\" research initiative", "summary": "1/ AI startup RunwayML introduces two new features for its video generator: \"Text-to-Speech\" for synthetic voices and \"Ratio\" for easy conversion of video formats.\r\n\r\n2/ RunwayML also announces a research initiative to develop \"world models\" to drive AI systems that can understand and simulate the visual world.\r\n\r\n3/ The company is addressing research challenges such as developing models that can create consistent environmental maps and realistic models of human behavior.\n\nhttps://the-decoder.com/runway-launches-two-new-video-ai-features-and-a-general-world-model-research-initiative/", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDecoder/comments/18mtux1/runway_launches_two_new_video_ai_features_and_a/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Is LibrePay safe to use?", "summary": "I am looking to setup a librepay account to recieve any sponsors for my projects.  \nI havn't really heard much about them, but are they still a good choice (and safe) to use now?
