AnyGPT can be  trained stably without any alterations to the current large language  model (LLM) architecture or training paradigms. Instead, it relies  exclusively on data-level preprocessing, facilitating the seamless  integration of new modalities into LLMs, akin to the incorporation of  new languages. We build a multimodal text-centric dataset for multimodal  alignment pre-training. Utilizing generative models, we synthesize the  first large-scale any-to-any multimodal instruction dataset. It consists  of 108k samples of multi-turn conversations that intricately interweave  various modalities, thus equipping the model to handle arbitrary  combinations of multimodal inputs and outputs. Experimental results  demonstrate that AnyGPT is capable of facilitating any-to-any multimodal  conversation while achieving performance comparable to specialized  models across all modalities, proving that discrete representations can  effectively and conveniently unify multiple modalities within a language  model.

I really want to do Bhairavi sadhana, although I am not able to understand with what attitude to approach this. Have been struggling with this for 3yrs.\n\nI feel guilty if I am approaching devi for my selfish needs or because I want something. Something doesnt feel right about it.\n\nAlso we are reminded in the temple again and again of how to have devotion and love for her.. \nI am unable to understand how to develop this when I know my intent might be to benefit myself.\n\nHow can I develop love with an expectation\n\nWhenever I have bowed to her, I have never asked for anything, neither do I particularly feel confident about wanting something that I would ask for it.. to something so much bigger than me.\n\nI would love to feel her blessings and do bhairavi sadhana for this.\n\nWhen i read the stuti.. i feel a sense of begging (which i have no issue with) but this is the closest ive got to a genuine attitude with devi. Reading the stuti.. i feel how am i asking for such great, big things.. having done nothing, why should i be blessed with it?\n\nEverything else feels like i would be fooling myself, if i thought I love her.\n\nI have heard how many people are simple devoted or were drawn. I am not sure what is my experience.\n\nPlease advise or share your experiences.\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Sadhguru/comments/1bg1w16/issue_in_approaching_devi/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "More anxious after mandala.

This allows you to safely share your medical details whenever you need to see a new doctor. \n\n\nDarnahi's Vision:\n=================\n\nThis tool wants to be your personal health assistant. In the future, very smart computer programs called language models will run on your own devices like phones or computers. These smart programs will understand all your personal health information while keeping it private and secure just for you. You'll be able to ask the program any health questions you have, and it will provide answers specifically based on your own medical details. It's like having a knowledgeable health concierge available whenever you need, but the concierge is actually an intelligent computer program giving you personalized health suggestions while protecting your privacy.\n \nDarnahi's LLM:\n=====================\nDarnahi currenlty uses a lightweight but smart computer program called 1b Llama. It works by combining two important parts:\n\n    RAG architecture: This helps the program quickly find and understand the specific health information it needs from your medical data.\n    \n    ChromaDB: This is like a special database that organizes and stores your health details in a way the computer program can easily access.\n\nBy using RAG and ChromaDB together, the 1b Llama program can efficiently retrieve your personal medical information and then provide health-related answers just for you based on that data.\n\nINSTALL NOW:\n\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1bg3lut/health_concierge/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The Green Rock of Hattusa Ancient City, Turkey, Corum", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1bg2pdh", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Ardhasiddhasana", "summary": "Can i do it with right leg first?

Irrelevant or tangential responses: The system provides a response that is related to the user's query but does not directly address their information need.\n\n3. Responses in the wrong format: The system generates a response that does not match the user's expected format, such as failing to provide a list or table when the query requires it.\n\n4.
