I am doing this with Python and opencv. First I apply a circular mask so that I only look at the area of the tray. Then I iterate through every frame, use a Gaussian blur, apply a black and white filter and use houghCircles to detect every circle or glass in the frame. That approach works well if I light the video using a very diffused light like a phone flashlight which lights the video evenly.  \nAs mentioned above this works just fine but only if the tray isn't wet because the water reflects the light and so the pixels are brighter than the threshold. Now the program detects lots of false circles (Image).  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fuwfigfc9i9c1.png?width=2076&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c360552181e9f2a1293414da79bbe20d2839f922\n\nWhat I tried:  \nAs you can see it's a matt and rough surface which should reduce the reflections in the first place.  \nI also tried to play around with the parameters like threshold, the light intensity and angle but with minor success.  \nI also read that polarised filters might help to reduce reflections but wouldn't that reduce the visibility of the glasses too?\n\nI am open to every solution whether it's a hardware solution or an improved version of my Code.

Also,\nit is the ability to interact with web that makes using a computer very\ninteresting. So, here is a list or ways or the different kinds of things\nwe can do with web from command line.\n\n# List of ideas\n\nThis is a expanding list of ideas of what can be done through the\nterminal.\n\n-   Dictionary\n-   Wikipedia\n-   Online sophisticated caluclator like wolfram alpha\n-   Searching specific websites like stack overflow and cheat.sh, xkcd\n-   API interaction through curl\n-   TUI interfaces for web applications like whatsapp, reddit\n-   Search engines\n-   Web browsers, usually text based\n-   Protocols like ftp, ssh, telnet\n-   Mail\n-   Generating temporary mails\n\n# List of known terminal web programs\n\n-   nchat: Use whatsapp, telegram etc from terminal using TUI.\n-   ssh: login to a remote computer and control it\n-   ftp: can download files through ftp protocol from ftp servers\n-   ffsend: cli interface to send webpage, quickly send files without\n    any login etc. Receiver can just use a http link to download.\n-   curl: queries a website, can access its api, headers, can also\n    download html.\n-   wget: recursively downloads all content of webpage\n-   tuir: reddit browser, python based.\n-   pyradio: python based radio program with ncurses interface.\n-   monolith: download entire web pages recursively\n-   wikit: connects to wikipedia to print summaries and even full pages.\n-   wiki-tui: TUI (not cli) built with rust to read wiki pages within\n    the terminal, nicely formatted.\n-   wiki: better version of wikit written in go with better formatting\n    and a less like pager\n-   yewtube: cli for youtube, can search, play, download and show\n    comments and also related videos.\n-   tmpmail: generates a temporary mail for use with various websites.\n    Use tmpmail -g to generate a new mail.\n-   w3m: a command line text browser, also lynx.\n-   how2: searches stack overflow for queries, default is bash, specify\n    language with -l\n-   dict: dictionary, just enter word you want to lookup as \\$1\n-   reader: displays URLs with images in terminal, pretty prints web\n    pages.\n-   xkcd-cli: view xkcd comics in terminal (using terminal kitty, images\n    can be viewed directly in terminal)\n-   cht.sh: searches cheatsheets of all languages\n-   neomutt: mail client, fork of mutt\n-   googlr: query google through cli\n-   dggr: query duckduckgo through cli\n\n# Notable ideas and their implementation\n\n## Dictionary\n\nIs installed through dictd package, while the command is dict. Get\nmeanings of words through it.\n\n## Wikipedia\n\nThe next level of getting info after dict is by a summary (or full page)\nfrom wikipedia. Of these, wiki-tui is a rust based program installed\nthorugh cargo and it provides a TUI. Wikit is npm based and install\noften fails for unknown reasons. wiki go client is a good alternative to\nit. It is also possible to directly query wikipedia through their API\nusing curl. Note that wikit only provides summaries and has no option\nfor full page, though that is often enough for most of our use cases.\n\n## Online sophisticated caluclator like wolfram alpha\n\nContinuing the theme of getting more info from web, access to a\nsophisticated calculator like wolfram alpha from terminal is great.\nWolfram alpha provides a free api of upto 200 queries per day which is\nmore than enough. Although qalc can do many of the calculations without\nneeding to use WA, it is however to have terminal access to wolfram\nalpha.\n\n## Searching specific websites like stack overflow and cheat.sh, xkcd\n\nTools like how2, cht.sh query specific websites. How2 queries stack\noverflow, while cht.sh queries cheat.sh website which contains a huge\nlist of programming language cheat sheets. These can be used if the\nquery is related to tech.\n\n## API interaction through curl\n\nThere are many APIs for jokes, quotes, etc. RAPID API is website through\nwhich lot of free and paid APIs can be discovered.\n\n## TUI interfaces for web applications like whatsapp, reddit\n\nTuir is a great python tui client to browse reddit. Most text based\nreddit posts can be read in it.\n\n## Search engines\n\nGooglr and ddgr are available and ddgr seems to better alternative as\ngooglr often fails. Search engines provide wonderful extension to above\ntheme of gaining more knowledge through web. They can be used two ways:\nfor short queries: answers can be directly viewed on terminal without\nneeding to use a GUI browser, and if required the result pages can be\nviewed in a browser directly.\n\n## Web browsers, usually text based\n\nw3m and lynx are good text based browsers.\n\n## Protocols like ftp, ssh, telnet\n\nSsh is easy way to login to a remote computer. Run sshd on the remote\ncomputer and then login to that using `ssh username@hostname -P 8022`\n8022 here is the port name. IP address can be used instead of hostname.\n\nFTP can be used to download files stored on an ftp server. Login with\nftp command followed by ftp url. Then use get or mget commands to\ndownload files. Local computer files can also be accessed simulatenously\nusing commands like lcd. Note the l prefix\n\n## Mail\n\nNeomutt is a wonderful client. Gmail can be easily configured in it\nusing google app ID. Neomutt is better than mutt in that it only shows\nrecent mail", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/18ujkkh/i_wrote_a_small_guide_or_note_how_to_use_command/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "LLMs are biased and don't match human preferences when evaluating text, study finds", "summary": "1/ A study shows that large language models (LLMs) exhibit cognitive biases and fail to match human preferences when evaluating text.

We propose an Unsupervised  Universal Segmentation model (**U2Seg**) adept at performing various image  segmentation tasks -- instance, semantic and panoptic -- using a novel  unified framework. U2Seg generates pseudo semantic labels for these  segmentation tasks via leveraging self-supervised models followed by  clustering; each cluster represents different semantic and/or instance  membership of pixels. We then self-train the model on these pseudo  semantic labels, yielding substantial performance gains over specialized  methods tailored to each task: a +2.6 AP**^(box)**  boost vs. CutLER in unsupervised instance segmentation on COCO and a  +7.0 PixelAcc increase (vs. STEGO) in unsupervised semantic segmentation  on COCOStuff. Moreover, our method sets up a new baseline for  unsupervised panoptic segmentation, which has not been previously  explored. U2Seg is also a strong pretrained model for few-shot  segmentation, surpassing CutLER by +5.0 AP**^(mask)**  when trained on a low-data regime, e.g., only 1% COCO labels.
