I'm initiating an open-source project called OpenTaxi ( and I'm looking for contributors or even just architecture discussion/feedback. \n\n**What is OpenTaxi's Goal?**\n\nThe goal is to establish a standard that can fully decentralize the ridesharing industry, transitioning from a Corporation/Contractor driver relationship to an Entrepreneur/Owner relationship. Instead of signing up as contractors, drivers would become independent business owners registered with their local governments. As part of the OpenTaxi standard, every driver would have their own dedicated server in the cloud, which they would pay for. With automated infrastructure deployment code, drivers' backends would be automatically deployed and standardized across all drivers. The decentralized aspect comes into play with the driver/passenger connection. Using a blockchain, passengers would post their ride details for all driver servers to see. Drivers can then post their server information, connecting the driver and passenger to begin traditional centralized server/client communication.\n\n**Why?**\n\nHonestly, I'm just really frustrated with how much Uber and Lyft take from their hardworking drivers. Uber and Lyft can take as much as 50-75% in some cases. I want to find a way to empower hardworking individuals. This is not meant to make anyone money but the drivers.  The purpose of standardizing and open source is to make it that there\u2019s no centralized entity that gets between the driver and passenger.  \n\n**Status**  \nCurrently I\u2019m just at the architecture/brain storming phase working on ways to standardize and architect things to avoid having to pay any centralized server costs. \n  \n**TLDR;** Developers create free open-source code, and drivers use this code to operate their own taxi businesses for free.\n\n**Discord** -   \n**Reddit** -   \n**Github** - ", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1asc1um/seeking_contributors_to_establish_a_decentralized/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "I want to measure the dimensions of iPhone using a reference point with known dimensions ( 1 inch sticker) by drawing lines and converting pixels to inches.

While cutting-edge diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion  (SD) and SDXL rely on supervised fine-tuning, their performance  inevitably plateaus after seeing a certain volume of data. Recently,  reinforcement learning (RL) has been employed to fine-tune diffusion  models with human preference data, but it requires at least two images  (\"winner\" and \"loser\" images) for each text prompt. In this paper, we  introduce an innovative technique called **self-play fine-tuning for  diffusion models** (**SPIN-Diffusion**), where the diffusion model engages in  competition with its earlier versions, facilitating an iterative  self-improvement process. Our approach offers an alternative to  conventional supervised fine-tuning and RL strategies, significantly  improving both model performance and alignment. Our experiments on the  Pick-a-Pic dataset reveal that SPIN-Diffusion outperforms the existing  supervised fine-tuning method in aspects of human preference alignment  and visual appeal right from its first iteration. By the second  iteration, it exceeds the performance of RLHF-based methods across all  metrics, achieving these results with less data.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1ashzi5/selfplay_finetuning_of_diffusion_models_for/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Sintel Dataset doubt", "summary": "I am trying to reproduce the results from [this CVPR paper]( They use the [Sintel]( dataset with 16-bit images, but when downloading the images [from this website]( I can see only 8-bit images.
