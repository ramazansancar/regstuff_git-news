All sorts of crazy , moronic debates on Allopathy vs Ayurveda/ Siddha \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\n\nOnly Sadhguru knows what exactly happened and why in this case. Medically you may see the effect ( subdural hematoma ) , cause is usually not clear in most such cases (especially when it happens with Sadhguru).\nSome speculations from \"what SG has previously said about himself in the public domain \"  :\n\n\n(1) His body in this lifetime has not seen the kind of Sadhana as he had in his previous lifetime as SadhGuru Sri Brahma. This body is not capable of taking immense loads alone. Because Dhyanalinga as the Shakthi moola is established they are able to offer such Initiations. Without the Dhyanalinga even a great Yogi can't offer Shoonya Initiations beyond a few dozen. It's said that Agasthya , Patanjali and Gautama Buddha offered Shoonya Dhyana to few people, beyond certain numbers they could not.\nSHAMBHAVI initiations are given only by him. Samyama also costs his system a lot.\n\n\n(2) Also during the Dhyanalinga Consecration he was actually supposed to leave and take Maha Samaadhi with the completion of Consecration. The Nature of the consecration is such that one has to leave when it's complete.\nHe stretched himself beyond all barriers of sanity and manifested the Dhyanalinga , which took a heavy toll on his system. All kinds of diagnosis were given where no concrete clear diagnosis was coming forth and Drs gave up hope. Finally some miracle like thing happened ( details available on mystic musings ) and he lives on and is using this life to offer hardcore spiritual processes for the common man , Consecrations and for various other purposes. But his body and energy system is under a lot of support from other people at the ashram.\n\n\n(3) In such a situation whenever he stretches himself , some problems do occur. In 2006 something similar but far much worse happened and Drs again gave up hope. Finally he fixed himself and also used some mystical aspects of Kailash to fix himself and people could see how vibrant he had become. What happened in 2006 was revealed by him in close meeting with volunteers . Since it's not officially published I will refrain from posting it here. It was not primarily a medical problem at all , manifestations were medical though , where Drs could not pin point either the cause / diagnosis ( in USA ).\n\n\n(4) Also , SG has faced some minor complications after some major Consecrations which he fixes silently but tells the public much later. He had some problems post linga Bhairavi and post Bangalore Yogeshwar linga Consecration.\n\n\n(5) His life is so busy that he hardly gets time to re-programme his system which he says he very much can if he gets time. During COVID times he got the much needed break but again he does the unthinkable. He establishes Kala bhairava dimension ( as Veerya Bindu ) within himself , which will grow , to be delivered to be fully consecrated in 2032. The basic form might come up in the kala bhairava mantap temple soon where  people can access it for conducting various processes.\nIt was also mentioned that he wanted to do it without Bali Poojas ( Animal sacrifice) , so to arrive at this technology he was deeply working on it. If he did it without animal sacrifice that would cost SadhGuru his life. \n\n\nSadhguru said , Kala bhairava as a Live Deity ( Mercury based ) which he will deliver in 2032 is going to be a difficult child , difficult labour, and might affect him adversely at such an age ( he will be 74+ years old in 2032 ). Already he has given hints of what is happening within him. It might not only be a difficult labour but also a complicated pregnancy , that's how it sounded to me.\nThe Veerya Bindu for the Deity of Kala bhairava was established within himself on 18 July 2020 and he estimated that it would be ready to deliver for Consecration as a Full fledged deity by 21 June 2032 ( 4356 days or one full solar cycle or ~ 12 years ).\n\nOriginal poster:", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Sadhguru/comments/1bk62sl/an_interesting_post_and_things_to_consider/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Secret RCMP report warns Canadians may revolt once they realize how broke they are", "summary": "", "link": "https://nationalpost.com/opinion/secret-rcmp-report-warns-canadians-may-revolt-once-they-realize-how-broke-they-are", "author": "None"}, {"title": "I just can't belive how strong willed our Guru is", "summary": "This has happened before as well.
