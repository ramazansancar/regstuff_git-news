I will first give a little background on the project and then explain our \n\nWe are a group of researchers looking at large collections of corporate proxy statements over time. There are about 10k statement per year and we are looking for 5 years. Each statement is between 50 to 150 pages. Specifically we are looking for the mention one 3 different topics. So to do this manually would require a LOT of reading!\n\nWe decided to use a supervised learning approach to train a logistics regression classifier. To do this we manually labelled roughly 700 sentences per topic we are looking for, and about 2000 \"irrelevant\" sentences. We also have a large set of verification sentences that have been classified by an other group, but we do not have access to their method. (hence we are trying to recreate it or something similar)\n\nWe have used SentenceTransformer and the pre-trained 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' model from huggingface to perform the embedding of each sentence. And the a supervised UMAP dimensional reduction to get out a 2D embedding of each sentence. These reduced embeddings were then used to train a Logistics Regression Classifier.  The results of this are shown for one topic below (top row is training data bottom row is verification/testing):\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI figured we could improve this by 'fine-tuning' the  'all-MiniLM-L6-v2' model. We did this using the outliers in the top left plot to generate a list of similar and non-similar sentence pairs and fitting the model to that. Which resulted in the following:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWe are pretty happy with the results. The Recall is good, we only missed 12% of the sentences which include that topic, and we had a lowish False Positive rate. All in all it seems like this method has significantly reduced the amount of reading our team will have to do!  \n\n\nWhat I would like to know is if there are any glaring mistakes that we made? Was using the supervised UMAP approach wise? Was our data set balanced enough? Even though we had 3 topics we did a binary classification (treating sentences from the other topics as 'irrelevant'), is that wise? Was the generation of the fine-tuning training data do correctly?  \n\n\nAny thoughts or constructive criticisms would be greatly appreciated.
