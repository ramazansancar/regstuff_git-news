Coders can stay relevant by sticking to basics and best practices, finding the right AI-based tools, having clear and precise communications with AI assistants, and being critical of AI outputs.\n      AI coding assistants can help with code completion and generation but understanding how the code fits into a larger system and problem-solving remain vital human skills. Generative AI can aid in learning new programming languages and kick-starting small projects.
