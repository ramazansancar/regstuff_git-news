However, in modern physics, the concept of a perfect vacuum has evolved due to our understanding of quantum mechanics, which acknowledges the presence of underlying quantum fields and energy fluctuations even in seemingly empty space.\n  \n\n\n\n  Full article: Space Vacuum Debate\n", "link": "https://www.emergentmind.com/posts/space-vacuum-debate", "published_js": "2023-07-09", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Automatic hyperparameter search with GPT3.5", "summary": "Summary:\n  \n      The article discusses the automatic hyperparameter search with GPT3.5 Insights in a Git repository.\n      The content suggests that creating a branch with an existing tag name might lead to unexpected behavior.\n  \n\n\n\n  Full article: Automatic hyperparameter search with GPT3.5\n", "link": "https://www.emergentmind.com/posts/github-artem9k-autohparamsearch-automatic", "published_js": "2023-07-09", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Sarah Silverman is suing OpenAI and Meta for copyright infringement - The Verge", "summary": "Summary:\n  \n      Comedian Sarah Silverman, along with authors Christopher Golden and Richard Kadrey, are suing OpenAI and Meta for copyright infringement.
