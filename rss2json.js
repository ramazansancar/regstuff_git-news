The article also delves deep into the concept of 'Evals', which are sets of measurements used to assess a model's performance on a task, and discusses various benchmarks and metrics used in the field of language modeling.\n      The article also highlights the pitfalls of conventional benchmarks and metrics, such as poor correlation with human judgments, poor adaptability to a variety of tasks, and significant score differences based on the evaluation implementation. It also explores the emerging trend of using powerful LLMs as reference-free metrics for evaluations, and presents several case studies where this approach has shown a high correlation with human judgments.\n  \n\n\n\n  Full article: Patterns for Building LLM-based Systems &amp; Products\n\n\n---\nPS: Emergent Mind is for sale.", "link": "https://www.emergentmind.com/posts/patterns-for-building-llm-based-systems-products", "published_js": "2023-08-02", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Magic Loops", "summary": "Summary:\n  \n      Magic Loops is a service that sends a daily summary of Hacker News at 7pm.\n      The service, named 'Create Loop', aims to keep its users updated with the latest news on the platform.\n  \n\n\n\n  Full article: Magic Loops\n\n\n---\nPS: Emergent Mind is for sale.", "link": "https://www.emergentmind.com/posts/magic-loops", "published_js": "2023-08-01", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Cryptography may offer a solution to the massive AI-labeling problem", "summary": "Summary:\n  \n      C2PA, an open-source internet protocol that uses cryptography to attach 'provenance' details to digital content, could offer a solution to the issue of identifying AI-generated content.
