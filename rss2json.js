I'd like some camera recommendations if possible. We're going to mount this camera (probably magnetically) on a steel beam about 15 feet up.  The camera will aim at a small raised stage with the band on it, and it will also be pointed at the area just in front of the stage, where the pastor gives his message. My question is, can we get away without using a TPZ camera and just have the camera 'look' at the stage, and then digitally zoom when the pastor is speaking?  if so, can we get recommendations on a camera that might accomplish this?  I am overwhelmed by amazon. I just spent about 3 hours browsing cameras and I am no closer to choosing one than when I started. Ideally we'd probably like to spend about $300 or less. I've seen some TPZ cameras that are in that price range, but I am not sure what all is needed to control them.

Recent autoregressive vision-language models like \\[Flamingo, PaLM-E\\], leveraging the long-context capability of Large  Language Models, have excelled in few-shot text generation tasks but  face challenges in alignment tasks. Addressing this gap, we introduce  the contrastive loss into text generation models, presenting the  COntrastive-Streamlined MultimOdal framework (**CosMo**), strategically  partitioning the language model into dedicated unimodal text processing  and adept multimodal data handling components. CosMo, our unified  framework, merges unimodal and multimodal elements, enhancing model  performance for tasks involving textual and visual data while notably  reducing learnable parameters. However, these models demand extensive  long-text datasets, yet the availability of high-quality long-text video  datasets remains limited. To bridge this gap, this work introduces **Howto-Interlink7M**, an inaugural interleaved video-text dataset featuring  comprehensive captions, marking a significant step forward.  Demonstrating its impact, we illustrate how Howto-Interlink7M enhances  model performance in image-text tasks. With 34% learnable parameters  and utilizing 72% of the available data, our model demonstrates  significant superiority over OpenFlamingo. For  instance, in the 4-shot flickr captioning task, performance notably  improves from 57.2% to 65.1%. The contributions of CosMo and Howto-Interlink7M are underscored by notable performance gains across  14 diverse downstream datasets encompassing both image-text and  video-text tasks.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1971ari/cosmo_contrastive_streamlined_multimodal_model/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "Coco Gauff shows off new serve during first round demolition at the Australian Open", "summary": "Coco Gauff shows off new serve during first round demolition at the Australian Open&nbsp;&nbsp;", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDEvMTUvc3BvcnQvY29jby1nYXVmZi1uZXctc2VydmUtYXVzdHJhbGlhbi1vcGVuLXdpbi1zcHQtaW50bC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFlaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyNC8wMS8xNS9zcG9ydC9jb2NvLWdhdWZmLW5ldy1zZXJ2ZS1hdXN0cmFsaWFuLW9wZW4td2luLXNwdC1pbnRsL2luZGV4Lmh0bWw?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-01-15", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Green Bay Packers dominate Dallas Cowboys to become first No. 7 seed to win an NFL playoff game", "summary": "Green Bay Packers dominate Dallas Cowboys to become first No. 7 seed to win an NFL playoff game&nbsp;&nbsp;", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDEvMTQvc3BvcnQvbmZsLXBsYXlvZmZzLXBhY2tlcnMtY293Ym95cy1zcHQtaW50bC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFZaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyNC8wMS8xNC9zcG9ydC9uZmwtcGxheW9mZnMtcGFja2Vycy1jb3dib3lzLXNwdC1pbnRsL2luZGV4Lmh0bWw?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-01-15", "author": "None"}]}}};
