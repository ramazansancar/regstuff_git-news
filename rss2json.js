How far have grammatical parsing approaches gotten?\n\nJust to sketch what an unsupervised grammatical parser would look like (in case this is a novel concept): You want to have a low-dimension sparse auto-encoder-like model classifying phrases into four or five categories whereby phrases in classification B all are all preceded by phrases in classification A and succeeded by phrases in classification C or A (but not more B phrases). The model will read a new word, add it to the bag-of-words in the current phrase and feed it to a phrase parsing model to see if that model decides this bag constitutes a single phrase or if the new word is part of the next phrase, and then either add the word to the current phrase or terminate the phrase before the new word. \n\nIntuitively it seems like the auto-encoding will classify-together phrases of nouns and adjectives and see them as preceding phrases composed of verbs and adverbs; if a verb gets sucked into \"subject\"-labeled phrase-bags it will probably reduce the predictive power of those subject phrases since they may sometimes be immediately followed by an object phrase or new subject rather than a predicate phrase.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1bheo6f/after_grammatical_parsing_does_word_order_matter/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Radion, an internet radio TUI client, written in Bash.", "summary": "[\n\n**radion** is an internet radio CLI client, written in Bash.\n\nRadion can be costumized as far as the station selecting program is concerned.
