Current built-in tools provide\n   * video analysis (as part of the main application) and\n   * natural language robotic control (as part of an example in the examples/ directory).\n* Functions are automatically passed to openai (when appropriate) during the normal course of a conversation and tool responses are automatically handled.\n\n**Broadcasting to external systems through the broadcasting adapter.**\n\n* If your conversation requires action in the real world (for other computers, robots, or IoT devices to act), the system has a broadcaster to broadcast system intentions across the network.\n* The prebuilt adapter provides Websocket support. I think MQTT would be a good fit as well, but it hasn't been implemented yet.\n\n**Background Processing for long running tasks**\n\n* Background tasks are handled through celery.\n* Current background tasks include offloading conversation embeddings and storage.\n\nThis application is in active development.\n\n**Some additional features that we're working on include:**\n\n* Automatic speaker diarization to facilitate voice recognition and conversation part assignments (with video assist).\n* Echo Cancellation to avoid feedback processing (best to be used with a headphone for now)\n* Similarity querying against the conversation data to allow for all-time conversation recall.\n* Better robot &lt;-&gt; system two-way communication and visual action processing.\n\n**More ambitious features include**\n\n* Automatic dataset training generation based on visual and auditory cues to facilitate automatic Pytorch model training against specific individuals.
