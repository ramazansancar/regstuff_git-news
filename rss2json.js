What kind of ridiculous statement is that?  I can acknowledge that my body is made up of the food I ate, that my emotions are fleeting, and that my psychological content is gathered from my experience.

And the goal to be blissed out every second of your life is so dumb. Life can be very hard and painful, and I don't care how much you meditate or read scriptures, you will always be vulnerable, and be exposed to pain. I think his advice can be so unaplicable to life.
