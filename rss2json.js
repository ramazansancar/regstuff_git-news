I'm hoping to gain some advice on better strategies to address similar incidents in the future.\nI am a 30-year-old Colombian man, and I was out on a date with a 35-year-old German woman. As we were returning home from the train station at night, we encountered a group of teenagers (12 to 15 years old, both genders, around 10-15 in total). They were hanging out and drinking. One of them, a young white boy, approached us, glass full of alcohol in hand, and told us, &quot;Ich mag keine Touristen, verpisst euch&quot; which translates to &quot;I don't like tourists, screw off.&quot;\nWhile he posed no physical threat, his words were offensive, and I felt the need to react. Back in my home country, the typical response might involve physical retaliation (a good old slap at least), but I was aware that could lead to legal trouble, actually hurting the kid, escalation of the situation, and would not necessarily make a good impression on my date.\nMy actual response was to call him out on his behaviour and insult him in return, even daring him to come closer, but I failed to effectively do so (my German is limited). My date, intervened, explaining that we were not tourists. By this moment, we surrounded (at a good distance), by his friends, who were there to back him up but at some moment realizing that it was their own friend being the asshole. Eventually, he was distracted and left. Following this, we continued on our way home.\nI am not as happy with the situation, as I did not feel in control and like I could have made a better impression on my date. She was cool with it afterwards and told me that he was just a kid. I'm sure that there could have been better ways to handle this though.\nA few alternative ways in which I think this could have gone better:\n\nTo insult him better: &quot;Du kleine Scheisse/Hurensohn, wir sind kein Touristen, aber wenn wir waren, was w\u00e4re das Problem?&quot; (&quot;You little shit/son of a whore, we are not tourists, but even if we were, what would be the problem?&quot;)\nTo switch to English and side with his friends: &quot;Are you guys friends with him? He is insulting me and my girlfriend for no reason at all, and now he wants you to back him up in his stupid actions. You may be friends of him but is he really a friend to you?\nTo challenge him to a fight: &quot;If you are not scared of fighting your own fights, how about a little 1-on-1 fight, with your consent? I will use only my left hand.&quot;\nTo belittle him: &quot;Are you so insecure about being the smallest of your friends that you have to insult strangers on the street?&quot;\n\nChatGPT also suggested a couple of interesting strategies:\n\n&quot;We are not tourists, but even if we were, what would be the problem with that? We're here trying to enjoy the night just as you are. How about growing up?\nRedirect Attention: &quot;It's a beautiful night, isn't it? We're just out enjoying it, same as you.&quot;\nAppeal to the group: &quot;Does everyone here feel the same way as your friend?&quot;\n\nIf there is something that I missed in this analysis, any other possibilities that I should consider, I would greatly appreciate hearing them from you.\nThank you!", "link": "https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/28335/handling-public-confrontation-strategically-and-assertively", "published_js": "2023-06-17", "author": "Juan Andres"}, {"title": "How to Address Perceived Unfriendly Service in a Restaurant", "summary": "I recently encountered an uncomfortable situation while dining out in Berlin, which has lingered in my mind, prompting me to seek advice on how to better handle such incidents in the future.\nLast Friday evening, I visited a large restaurant bar located on the outskirts of Berlin with two of my friends, both of whom are German and identify as lesbian. As a 30-year-old brown, male Colombian, our group stood out among the primarily middle-aged, local clientele. We saw the place and got in just to get a drink, and also because we thought that it would be fun to get into a place so different from the ones you tipically find in Berlin (bars or kneipes full of cosmopolitan young people).\nOur waiter was a well-built, bald man, with a couple of small tattoos on his hand, possibly of North African heritage. Although he was not outwardly disrespectful or offensive, his demeanor was markedly serious and somewhat unfriendly towards us. This behavior was particularly noticeable when contrasted against his more affable interactions with other patrons - including a typical German family.\nAs the evening concluded and it was time to settle the bill, an inadvertent mistake on my part led to me paying less than the actual amount. The waiter's subsequent reaction insinuated that he believed we were attempting to trick him, further dampening our experience. I rectified by asking for the correct amount and paying it.\nIn response to the waiter's demeanor, I chose not to tip him and discussed his behavior privately with my friends, trying afterwards to brush off the situation. However, in hindsight, I'm considering other approaches:\n\nOption 1: Offer a tip and upon acceptance, address the issue by saying:\n\n&quot;N\u00e4chste mal du kannst nett zu uns sein. Du warst unfreundlich und ernst mit uns heute. Wir sind Kunden auch.&quot;\nTranslation: &quot;Next time, you could be friendlier towards us. You were unfriendly and serious with us today. We are customers too.&quot;\n\n\nOption 2: Address the situation more directly by asking:\n\n&quot;Entschuldigen Sie, gibt es einen Grund, warum Sie so unfreundlich zu uns sind?&quot;\nTranslation: &quot;Excuse me, is there a reason why you are so unfriendly to us?&quot;\n\n\n\nSomething that adds to the challenge: My German speaking is not great but just good enough, and I often find it challenging to express myself clearly in tense or confrontational situations when it's not English or Spanish.\n\nAI Suggestion 1:\n\n&quot;Sie sind ernsthaft und unfreundlich zu uns, aber zu anderen Kunden scheinen Sie viel freundlicher zu sein. Haben wir irgendetwas getan, was Sie beleidigt hat?&quot;\nTranslation: &quot;Excuse me, we couldn't help but notice a difference in the way you interacted with us compared to other customers. Is there a specific reason for this?&quot;\n\n\nAI Suggestion 2:\n\n&quot;N\u00e4chstes Mal k\u00f6nnten Sie freundlicher zu uns sein. Wir sind auch Kunden und h\u00e4tten uns eine freundlichere Behandlung gew\u00fcnscht.&quot;\nTranslation: &quot;Next time, you could be friendlier towards us. We are customers too and would have appreciated friendlier treatment.&quot;\n\n\n\nNow, I'd like to ask this community: are there any other possibilities that neither I nor the AI have considered that could be even more optimal than these?", "link": "https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/28334/how-to-address-perceived-unfriendly-service-in-a-restaurant", "published_js": "2023-06-17", "author": "Juan Andres"}]}}};
