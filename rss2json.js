I'm from South Korea looking to do masters in CompLing/NLP/language tech in German universities this year, and was wondering if anyone could take a look at my specs and possibly share some two cents.\n\nAbout me:\n- Currently a Korean/English simultaneous interpreter, with Master of Arts degree in KR/EN interpretation from a Korean uni. 4 years work experience and GPA 3.6/4.0 if that's of any relevance\n\n- Bachelor in German literature and English literature. GPA 2.77/4.0 (Undergrad years werent my best)\n\n- No courses taken or any experience with anything math/statistics/compsci\n\nMy specs are really very humbling and likely not the best fit for a compling or nlp degree from admission point of view, but I was always interested in languages and after several years in a field of work I'm good at but not too passionate in, I'd love to try a new field of study. \n\nI am fully aware that this will be a pretty big shift and I will need to do a LOT of self-study, esp in math/stat/tech.\n\nMy long-term goal is to either be in the industry for the machine translation sector (likely a tech job) or if I decide to go academic, study preservation of endangered languages.\n\nSo far I've looked at Saarland, Konstanz, Potsdam, Heidelberg and Stuttgart. \n\nI ran into lots of good words about Saarland and Stuttgart, but not sure if they will accept me. It would be be best if they do - I'm willing to do coursework prior to the beginning of the semester if needed. \n\nI'm not fluent in German (B1 at best) but have experience living in Bonn and really like the country, also have friends there who can help be settle in. Also it seems German universities are renowned for compling too, so that would def work for me! :)\n\nWould appreciate any tips, TIA!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/18ye1an/asking_for_tips_on_doing_masters_in_germany_noncs/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How Beneficial is it to have this in your sadhana space?

A bunch of subjects were interviewed, and I am trying to predict, based on this interview, what choice they will make in the future (lets say, buy/not buy). There is no a-priori hypothesis, and we are hoping NLP + machine learning can identify some useful predictors. I'm using a sentence transformer (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) from hugging-face to plug in the interviews, and get a vector of embeddings per subject. If I add the 384 features to a simple logistic regression, I can predict the outcome. But what I really need, now, is to understand what in their text actually gave us the signal that was used to predict the outcome. \n\nI was looking around on how to interpret sentence embeddings, but I did not find any satisfactory or intuitive way to do this. I resorted to some creativity: I could cycle through each word for each subject, find words that are very similar within that subject and across subjects (e.g. using a dot product from the corresponding token embedding), mask them out, rerun the embeddings, rerun the logistic regression, and by iterating across words, see which words drive the performance of the model down. Alternatively I can just randomly censor 10% of the words x number of times, and apply some sort of weight to a word whenever the performance of my logistic regression drops, to figure out which words contribute the most. \n\nIs there any tool that does something like this already available? Is there a simpler way to go about understanding what in the subjects's text drives the prediction? Is my \"solution\" reasonable? I would appreciate any feedback! thanks in advance.
