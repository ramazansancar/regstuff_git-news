The complete PDF with images is here:\n\n[ and\n\n[\n\nComplex devices, quadcopters, radios and 3d printing, come from the garage hobby scene.\n\nGarden robots, when they come, will flow from a collaborative project that networks research together.\n\nThis is an attempt at an open-source simian tool technology, and a garden robot.\n\nThe fundamental difference here is the robot arm, which is a hybrid mechanism. It doesn't exist anywhere else except for this open-source research, based on RepRap 3D printer technology and telescopic linear slides, it is cheap, precise and you can build it yourself.\n\nIt is a mini telescopic crane that has higher force than articulated arms. It's not just handy for gardening, it can also be a wall art machine unlike any other.\n\nThus, a crafty sister project for the cultivator mechanoid is for wall art: It\u2019s a mechanism that you can knock about, load into a car, throw grit on, and it\u2019s fine for many different jobs, perhaps to add a dab of paint to rundown walls.\n\nWhat\u2019s the Coltimech?\n\nIt\u2019s a rover that can complete 5-8 farm tasks. The tool system resembles a gun turret mechanism. Rather than shooting bullets in any direction, it rapidly moves tools backwards and forwards, to sow, weed and dig agroecology polycultures. There\u2019s a hose under the arm to emit water from a tank in a chassis box.\n\nArticulated arms are a silly piece of a garden robot, so we rewrote the rule-book based on technology used in pallet-moving-forks and fire-engine aerial apparatus.\n\nIt\u2019s a kind of robot meant for small farms and country homes with land. You can rent one for a week if you want a food garden, and it will work 20 hours a day on complex designs.\n\nYou can also steer it around your garden by sliding your fingers on a smartphone and squirt water at people for a party trick. It\u2019s a very expensive water pistol, mist fountain, massager, party drink waiter, singing flower delivery bot. It can work for you day and night with an infra-red camera, phone CMOS, AI mapping and 1TB storage. It analyses precise 2D and 3D maps of farm, garden and landscape design.\n\nAt the tool-end there is an automatic-tool-changer, like a food processor port with slow rotations, which can clip on different garden tools to care for food and flowers.\n\nThe tools are profiled and selected through 3D visualization and vector math:\n\n\u2022 **Seed depositor** \u2013 8 to 20 variety seed patches at 20 m2.h\n\n\u2022 **Foliage clipper** \u2013 for mowing weeds and foliage\n\n\u2022 **Drill Digger / Auger** \u2013 also for uprooting entrenched weeds\n\n\u2022 **Claw**\n\n\u2022 **Hoe** \u2013 A simple trusty tool for abrading and dealing with slugs\n\n\u2022 **A soil probe** \u2013 theoretical, current tech is dubious\n\n\u2022 **A bore drill**  \u2013 to core tubes of compost into the ground\n\nField bots will enhance human abilities with super-human ones, for back-straining, ground-level observations and errands 140 hours a week. They will print your designs as a physical flower bed. They will check seedlings every hour for slugs and bugs, map every plant, node and fruit in graphs and optimize precision harvests of chemical-free fruit and veg.\n\nThe research encompasses a diverse array of disciplines, mechatronics, biophysics, AI and wildlife. It is so varied and fascinating. As a hobby it is a good way to discover astonishing facts of science and technology.\u2006 The following is a design guide for labs and university students.

It combines the freedom of lower-level GUI libraries with modern C techniques, offering both simplicity and convenience. Its main features are its built in lightweight dependence and its flexibility, its cross platform support. It currently supports Linux, Windows and MacOS, has a zlib license, and due to its use of STB and miniaudio, supports many data formats.\n\n## Introduction to RSGL\n\n\n\nRSGL, short for Riley's Simple GUI Library, is a tool designed to streamline the development of graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for applications and games. At its core, RSGL serves as a modular and cross-platform solution, offering developers the freedom to create GUIs easily while overcoming common challenges encountered in GUI development.\n\nBy encapsulating essential GUI functionalities within a lightweight and versatile library, RSGL empowers developers to focus on creativity rather than wrestling with technical complexities.\n\n## Background of RSGL\n\nMuch like SDL RSGL tries to not get in the users way. But unlike SDL, RSGL tries to be more modernized and do more for the user. Another library RSGL can be compared to is Raylib. I did not know about Raylib until after I had already created my initial design of RSGL. On the surface Raylib and RSGL have very similar designs. Although, RSGL has different design choices and a stronger focus on being lightweight. For example, all of RSGL's internal dependencies are very lightweight and most are designed to be so. While the dependencies Raylib uses are not designed to be lightweight, such as GLFW. RSGL uses RGFW instead of GLFW, the .o output of GLFW is ~280kb while RGFW's is ~46kb. Nevertheless Raylib and RSGL and both good choices for a GUI Library and the one you choose to use might change depending on your taste and circumstance.\n\nAnother similarity between Raylib and RSGL is that they both use OpenGL abstraction layers. RLGL and RGL respectively. I won't go into too much detail on the differences here. But it is very important to note how these both make their respective library all that stronger. The software creator can easily compile between modern and legacy OpenGL. RGL also allows the program to render using legacy functions during runtime. This allows the program to have a fail safe, just another way RSGL provides convenience to the user.\n\n## Using the code\n\nEnough talking about how great RSGL is. Here is an example so you can decide for yourself is RSGL is really worth all the praise.\n\nc \n#define RSGL_NO_AUDIO /* we don't want to link with miniaudio.h */\n#define RSGL_IMPLEMENTATION\n#include \"RSGL.h\"\n\n#include &lt;stdbool.h&gt;\n\nint main() {\n    /* create window and pass arg to make sure it's centered */\n    RSGL_window* win = RSGL_createWindow(\"example\", RSGL_RECT(0, 0, 500, 500), RSGL_CENTER);\n\n    bool legacy = false;\n\n    bool running = true;\n    while(running) {\n/* check events until there are no more events to check */\n        while(RSGL_window_checkEvent(win)) {\n            if (win-&gt;event.type == RGFW_quit || RSGL_isPressedI(win, RGFW_Escape)) {\n                running = false;\n                break;\n            }\n            \n            /* if the space bar is pressed, toggle rendering using opengl legacy */\n            if (win-&gt;event.type == RSGL_keyPressed &amp;&amp; win-&gt;event.keyCode == RGFW_Space) {\n               legacy = !legacy;\n               RSGL_legacy(legacy);\n            }\n        }   \n \n        /* draw a basic rectangle and clear the screen */\n        RSGL_drawRect(RSGL_RECT(200, 200, 200, 200), RSGL_RGB(255, 0, 0));\n        RSGL_window_clear(win, RSGL_RGB(255, 255, 255));\n    }\n    \n    RSGL_window_close(win);\n}\n\n\nCompiling :\nwindows : gcc &lt;file.c&gt; -lopengl32 -lshell32 -lgdi32\nlinux: gcc &lt;file.c&gt; -lGLX -lX11 -lm\nmacos : gcc &lt;file.c&gt; -framework Foundation -framework AppKit -framework OpenGL -framework CoreVideo\n\nNOTE : This is a very basic example, there are plenty far less basic examples included in the repo.\n\n## Points of Interest\n\nThe overall features of RSGL, as bulleted list are :\n\n- No external dependencies, all the libraries required are included in RSGL and are also very lightweight\\\n- Supports multiple platforms, windows, MacOS, linux, ect\n- Supports multiple versions of OpenGL (even allowing you to switch during runtime)\n- Uses other small lightweight dependencies\n- OpenGL abstraction layer : RGL (which is its own single-header library too)\n- Supports multiple font and image formats due to stb_truetype.h and stb_image.h\n- Supporst multiple audio formats due to miniaudio.h\n- Many examples included\n- Free and Open Source with a very flexible license\n\n### RSGL Modules\n  RSGL_NO_WIDGETS (makes it so RSGL doesn't include widget functions)\n\nRSGL_NO_AUDIO (makes it so RSGL doesn't include audio functions)\n\nRSGL_NO_WINDOW - no RSGL_window, RSGL_graphics is used instead [this is for using a differnt window manager other than RGFW ]\n\nRSGL_NO_TEXT - do not include text rendering functions\n\nRGFW_NO_WIDGETS - do not include widgets\n\nRSGL_NO_AUDIO - do not include audio functions\n\nRSGL_NO_MINIAUDIO_IMPLEMENTATION - do not have #define MINIAUDIO_IMPLEMENTATION in\nthis header (you'll have to link miniaudio some other way to use audio)\n\nRSGL_NO_SAVE_IMAGE - do not save/load images (don't use RSGL_drawImage if you use this),\n\nRSGL_drawImage saves the file name + texture so it can load it\nwhen you ask for it later. This disables that\n\n### License\nRSGL uses the libpng license, this means you can use RSGL freely as long as you do not claim you wrote this software, mark altered versions as such and keep the license included with the header.\n\n## final note\nThe RSGL Repo can be found at  :\n", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/1b015pk/rsgl_modular_headeronly_crossplatform_gui_library/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Are all of the postings on the Archaeological Institute of America field school bulletin legitimate?", "summary": "I have been looking at different postings on [\n\nand found one I am very interested in.

Many of you mentioned that there's usually a dedicated person managing the presentation to ensure the lyrics are advanced at the right moments.\n\nIn our small community, we face a challenge due to limited volunteers, which led me to explore the possibility of automating this process. With today's voice recognition technology, combined with song detection capabilities (similar to Shazam), it seems feasible to automatically scroll through the lyrics in real-time as the song progresses.\n\nI've developed a small prototype and found that it's indeed possible. However, refining this tool to be universally user-friendly is quite complex. Additionally, I can't offer it for free since it requires significant computing resources for voice recognition to run on powerful servers.\n\nThis brings me to my question for you: Would you find such a tool valuable, even if there's a cost involved? Your feedback is crucial as it will determine whether I continue to invest time and energy into this project or if I should consider discontinuing it.\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts.
