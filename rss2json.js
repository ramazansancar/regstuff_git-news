They are being rapidly adopted due to their potential benefits and the hype around AI. LLMs, such as Transformers, can learn the contextual relationship of values within a sequence, allowing for faster training times and larger model parameter sizes. The article also discusses the challenges and ongoing research trends in LLMs.\n      LLMs can be generally categorized into three categories: encoder only, decoder only, and encoder-decoder architecture. They can complete many different tasks without needing to be trained from scratch for each task. However, their ability to follow user instructions can be underwhelming, which is a problem that researchers are trying to solve.
