This article aims to shed light on the collection and usage of biometric data, providing a clearer understanding of the technology.    \n\n\nMyth: Biometrics steals privacy In the modern world, there is a fear that people will have no personal space left where they can be alone, their images are captured by biometric systems and thus become available to third parties who can use them for any purpose.    \n\n\nWhen biometric systems \"capture\" an image of a face or other body part, they process the information and convert it into special digital objects called biometric templates. Therefore, photographs and other images are not stored in biometric databases, like fingerprint images in police systems. Biometric templates can be compared to complex formulas that are completely unreadable to humans. When processing an image, the system compares the template to others, for example, one already stored in the database or was simultaneously read from an access card. Essentially, it is about determining the close correspondence of two mathematical formulas in some common measurement space. They do not contain any personal information: last name, first name, date of birth, address, etc. Therefore, it is difficult to extract any benefit from them without linking them to personal information.    \n\n\nLearn more here [**", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1al0fu3/the_biggest_facial_recognition_myths/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Cheap webcam to test Visual SLAM algorithms with ROS", "summary": " \n\nHi, I'm new to the sub, Im trying to run Orb Slam and other v/vi-slam algorithms. **ROS** had issues while running with my Laptop's built-in camera.
