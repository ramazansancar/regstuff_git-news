I'm from South Korea looking to do masters in CompLing/NLP/language tech in German universities this year, and was wondering if anyone could take a look at my specs and possibly share some two cents.\n\nAbout me:\n- Currently a Korean/English simultaneous interpreter, with Master of Arts degree in KR/EN interpretation from a Korean uni. 4 years work experience and GPA 3.6/4.0 if that's of any relevance\n\n- Bachelor in German literature and English literature. GPA 2.77/4.0 (Undergrad years werent my best)\n\n- No courses taken or any experience with anything math/statistics/compsci\n\nMy specs are really very humbling and likely not the best fit for a compling or nlp degree from admission point of view, but I was always interested in languages and after several years in a field of work I'm good at but not too passionate in, I'd love to try a new field of study. \n\nI am fully aware that this will be a pretty big shift and I will need to do a LOT of self-study, esp in math/stat/tech.\n\nMy long-term goal is to either be in the industry for the machine translation sector (likely a tech job) or if I decide to go academic, study preservation of endangered languages.\n\nSo far I've looked at Saarland, Konstanz, Potsdam, Heidelberg and Stuttgart. \n\nI ran into lots of good words about Saarland and Stuttgart, but not sure if they will accept me. It would be be best if they do - I'm willing to do coursework prior to the beginning of the semester if needed. \n\nI'm not fluent in German (B1 at best) but have experience living in Bonn and really like the country, also have friends there who can help be settle in. Also it seems German universities are renowned for compling too, so that would def work for me! :)\n\nWould appreciate any tips, TIA!", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/18ye1an/asking_for_tips_on_doing_masters_in_germany_noncs/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "Barcelona completes a dramatic comeback win with last-gasp penalty", "summary": "Barcelona completes a dramatic comeback win with last-gasp penalty&nbsp;&nbsp;", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDEvMDUvc3BvcnQvYmFyY2Vsb25hLWxhLWxpZ2EtY29tZWJhY2stcGVuYWx0eS1zcHQtaW50bC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFfaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyNC8wMS8wNS9zcG9ydC9iYXJjZWxvbmEtbGEtbGlnYS1jb21lYmFjay1wZW5hbHR5LXNwdC1pbnRsL2luZGV4Lmh0bWw?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-01-05", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 undecided on future as contract winds down", "summary": "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 undecided on future as contract winds down&nbsp;&nbsp;", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDEvMDQvc3BvcnQva3lsaWFuLW1iYXBwZS1wc2ctY29udHJhY3Qtc3B0LWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBV2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjQvMDEvMDQvc3BvcnQva3lsaWFuLW1iYXBwZS1wc2ctY29udHJhY3Qtc3B0LWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-01-04", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Youcef Atal: Algerian soccer star given suspended sentence by French court, fined $49,000 for Israel-Gaza post", "summary": "Youcef Atal: Algerian soccer star given suspended sentence by French court, fined $49,000 for Israel-Gaza post&nbsp;&nbsp;", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDEvMDQvc3BvcnQveW91Y2VmLWF0YWwtaXNyYWVsLWdhemEtcG9zdC1pbnRsLXNwdC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFZaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyNC8wMS8wNC9zcG9ydC95b3VjZWYtYXRhbC1pc3JhZWwtZ2F6YS1wb3N0LWludGwtc3B0L2luZGV4Lmh0bWw?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-01-04", "author": "None"}]}}};
