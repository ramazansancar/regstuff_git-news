Examples that come to mind are LIFT, SuperPoint and UnsuperPoint.\n\nHistorically more classical extractors like FAST (I know technically still \"learned\", but you know what I mean) and descriptors have shown more prominence in this domain. That isn't to say that I haven't seen deep learning featuring in SLAM systems (Andrew Davison's lab has some really cool work) but I've not really seen anything resembling a deep-learned feature detector used in a SLAM system.\n\nI've been wondering why this is. It could be that since the development of good SLAM systems is more profitable now (especially with the rise of VR/AR) that people don't tend to shout about their incremental improvements or want to give away their special sauce as part of their integration. Maybe learned feature detectors are being used but they're trade secrets. It's also possible that despite the promise of more robust features and correspondences, certain practical limitations have gotten in the way.\n\nDoes anyone else have any input on this? Are you aware of learned feature detection for ego-motion being used in industry?
