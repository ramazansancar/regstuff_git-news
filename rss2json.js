One complains a lot about messiness in shared spaces. Ironically the person she replaced was extremely messy, so even though from my perspective the place has gotten a lot cleaner, the amount of complaining is at an all time high. I feel like the way she complains is very accusatory and provoking. For example if I'm walking by her she says &quot;Hey! There is a dirty dish in the sink! I am trying to cook! Please clean it out!&quot;, and either I do it because its mine or explain to her it's not mine. She's also made statements like &quot;I feel like some people do more than others&quot; and I have no clue how to respond.\nOf course I want to live in a clean place. But I find the way she is approaching this to be very stressful. It's like she phrases her complaints as a personal attack. We don't have any cleaning system/schedule but each time I try to put one together it falls apart. For example dirty dishes may end up in the sink because no one is emptying the dishwasher. But then some people say they don't use the dishwasher.\nHow can I get it so we're not always fighting about cleaning? I really don't like how when I walk by her she unloads a laundry list of complaints, should I tell her to schedule a meeting? At the end of the day everyone else is OK with the way things are in terms of cleaning. She's also the one who uses the kitchen the most.", "link": "https://interpersonal.stackexchange.com/questions/28337/one-roommate-complains-a-lot-about-cleaning-in-an-attacking-sort-of-way", "published_js": "2023-06-19", "author": "aceslump"}, {"title": "Are there any networks based on asking for help for someone else?", "summary": "I feel like I recently had a tiny insight with a lot of potential.\nIt\u2019s really hard to ask for help, for yourself.\nIt\u2019s really easy to ask for help, for someone else.\nWhy?\nBecause you lack the self-consciousness that inhibits you from asking, because it\u2019s somebody else.
