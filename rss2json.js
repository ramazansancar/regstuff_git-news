The output would be the name of 3-5 movies it suspects the plot to describe with varying confidence levels.\n\nThe expectation from the project is not necessarily coming up with something research paper worthy, but definitely having some level of innovation or complexity.\n\nI haven't worked on NLP projects before so needed a little help with some questions:\n\n1.
