(2020) [https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/kj364n/c\\_logging\\_library\\_something\\_ive\\_been\\_working\\_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/kj364n/c_logging_library_something_ive_been_working_on/)\n2.

(2022) No update\n\nUnlike the previous years, as we grow older and wiser, I'm now aware that it's not going to be \"finished\" any time soon. However, I can present it to you at a mature enough stage where I can, from now on, shift my focus to another project that I have barely started working on - a graphics engine.\n\nA lot has happened in the past years. I got a job in the automotive industry and even got promoted recently, so It's all going well for me. And I want to thank you for the support until now and for the great critique and advice I've gotten on my previous posts about the logger, it has helped me so much for what it's worth.\n\nAnyway, I want to keep the post short and simple. So, why yet another logger? I've answered that in the documentation, but in short, I know it's the most banal project idea you've laid your eyes on recently, but in fact, it's actually an amazing learning experience. Depending on how deep you are willing to get to, writing a logger entails quite a lot of concepts, both deep language-specific knowledge and general computer science topics. If you were to ask me what's been the most pivotal project for my learning path, I would choose the logger instead of any half-baked graphics engine I've written in a heartbeat.\n\nAs always, I would appreciate it If you check it out, write a critique, an opinion, or blatantly assault me, it's all welcomed if it's aimed towards improvement and perfection. Contributions are appreciated as well, of course:  [https://github.com/ChristianPanov/lwlog](https://github.com/ChristianPanov/lwlog)\n\nIf you find it interesting enough you could also star it, that would be appreciated.\n\nSo what's been done since last year - overall rework and restructuring of the codebase, added asynchronous logging with the appropriate configurations that can be applied to it, which is probably the most notable of all changes, also added basic log message post formatting with fmt/std::format, depending on what you are using, which has been missing for a long time(such a basic feature, what a shame), and finally, comprehensive documentation overhaul. And quite a lot of other things in between, of course.\n\nWhile I'll be shifting my focus to a new project, I remain committed to maintaining and improving the logger. Upcoming plans include refining the CMake file and enhancing the file sink with file mapping.\n\nThank you for your support and valuable feedback.

Even for phones that weren't very popular at all. Besides, there are bids on most of the listings proving people are interested... but why? \n\nA part of me wants to buy an old phone just to dick about with it/experience what I couldn't afford while younger, but then again, it's not really worth it. But surely all these buyers aren't doing that? And in regards to poor people, surely they'd buy a budget friendly newer phone? It'd surely be a lot more capable. I'm just puzzled as to why anyone is buying them at all. Dealers? Maybe? Perhaps I've answered my own question.
