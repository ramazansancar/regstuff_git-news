I understand we want to optimize the (X, Y, Z) of 3D points, and pose `(R, t)` for all cameras, assuming that we define **camera 0** as the world origin. However, one of my confusions is:\n\nFor every **camera i** in the scene, which of the following do we do?\n\n1. only set up one `(R, t)` associated with that camera, representing the transform between **camera i** and **camera 0**\n2. set up `(R, t)` with all other cameras, and we optimize all of it.\n\nI'm leaning towards the 2. solution, since you don't necessarily have a good feature matches between **camera i** and **camera 0**. Having a transform with other cameras could give a better constraint. However, we'd end up getting C(N, 2) sets of `(R, t)` to optimize, which could be inefficient.\n\n====================================\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy second confusion is, if we decide to implement the 2. solution, **how do we constrain these (R, t) together?**\n\nTo simplify it, let's assume we only have 4 cameras. And we want to reproject 3D point onto **camera 1**.\n\nIf we chose 1. solution, I understand that we:\n\n1. Transform 3D point (X, Y, Z), defined in world frame (**camera 0** frame), into **camera 1** frame, using `(R, t)` associated with **camera 1**.\n2. Project the result from 1. onto **camera 1** image plane, and calculate the reprojection loss.\n\nHowever, if we chose 2. solution, we could have so many paths to transform 3D point (X, Y, Z) into **camera 1** frame, since we now have a `(R, t)` for every pair **camera i, j**, for example,\n\n* world frame =&gt; camera 1\n* world frame =&gt; camera 2 =&gt; camera 1\n* world frame =&gt; camera 3 =&gt; camera 1\n* world frame =&gt; camera 2 =&gt; camera 3 =&gt; camera 1\n\n(Note that world frame is defined as **camera 0** frame by me)\n\nThe path we chose will affect which `(R, t)` we'll be optimizing, so I figure we should pick a good way to constraint these `(R, t)`. One of a possible solution I can think of is that we only optimize the `(R, t)` between world frame and **camera 1** frame when minimizing reprojection error. Then, we can set up another loss function where we minimize the pose error, saying that:\n\n&gt;The `(R, t)` of **world frame =&gt; camera 1**  \nshould be as close to  \nThe `(R, t)` of **world frame =&gt; camera 2 =&gt; camera 1** as possible.  \nSame with other paths.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAny thoughts is appreciated!!
