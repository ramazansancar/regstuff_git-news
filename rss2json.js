Being enlightened doesn't necessarily mean that one is a chakreshwara. The example Sadhguru used was that Gautama the buddha's method only included the path of awareness, which is just 1 of the 112 methods that Shiva departed to his disciples. Sadhguru said somewhere that though there was a galaxy of enlightened beings at one point in time, at most there would not have been more than a few dozen throughout history (including those that he was aware of ) that had attained to chakreshwara. In terms of our limited experience of life, even if we look at in terms of face value rather than looking at it on the energy level, it is clearly clearly evident that Sadhguru is the most sensible being on the planet. It gives me shivers to think that there were others in human history who had attained to chakreshwara and were at the same stature that Sadhguru is currently at, but they didn't get the opportunity to influence humanity in such a way that would have prevented many of the calamities created by human beings. Sadhguru is probably the first chakreshwara in human history who was given a microphone to speak to the whole world. My thinking is that if can create the conditions for it, we can make way for others of that level of capability. Even if we ourselves are not capable of that, the least we can do is nurture others in that direction.
