I don't mean Jupyter Notebook viewer like [nbpreview]( that still uses Python.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nI am tired of completing a project and then trying to remember and re-do all of the complicated commands I used three months later. I currently use .txt notes, but that's not great as I actively have to remember keeping them up to date. Using them also sucks, because you have to copy them over, easily forgetting something. Something like the script command also sucks, because it will save the entire mess I produced, not just the commands that ultimately ended up doing the job.\n\n**I can't use Jupyter Notebook with bash\\_kernel**, because of its many limitations like: 1) terminal isn't interactive (I still want to be able to use the cell like a normal terminal) 2) output size limitation (good terminal will be just fine even with many lines, Jupyter crumbles) 3) insufficient auto-complete support 4) no subshell support (like Poetry)\n\n**Warp terminal** looks good, but there's no way I would ever be allowed to use that in the large corporation I currently work for. And in general, the idea of having to log-in into your terminal just to do ls is almost offensive for me.\n\nI found [ and tried all of the suggestions, but except for those two I mentioned, nothing has code blocks.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/1b9s833/something_like_jupyter_notebook_for_terminalshell/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The US economy added 275,000 jobs last month, more than expected", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/jobs-report-february-03-08-24/index.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Great Open source software for different Creative Endeavors like Music Production, Gamedev, Photo editing etc.", "summary": "I'm a fan of open-source software, or rather, software that offers great user experience and a clear, appealing user interface. These are qualities I often find in projects crafted with passion and a deep understanding of their audience, traits frequently found in open-source projects I guess. Thats why I wanted to start a little discussion about programs for all the different types of artists.\n\nLet me start off with my favorite, which started this thought. There's something called Godot. It's a game engine and it's open source. The quality of the software is absolutely fantastic, and it also has an incredible UI and user experience. I come more from an artistic and \"gamedev\" side, so I also included stuff commonly seen in gamedev like pixelart software.  \n\n\nFor now here is my list with programs off the top of my head:  \n\u2013 DAW Music Production (LMMS, horrible UX in my opinion)  \n\u2013 Chiptune (Famistudio, made by solodev, great)  \n\u2013 3D Modeling (Blender, I guess fantastic program, overwhelming UI which is understandable for 3d)  \n\u2013 Photo editing (GIMP, almost acceptable I guess)  \n\u2013 Painting (Krita, pretty good)  \n\u2013 Pixel art (Aseprite, kind of open source... you can compile it yourself, also fantastic program)  \n\u2013 Sound design (Audacity, horrible UX imo)  \n\u2013 Game development (Godot, fantastic program)  \n\u2013 Video editing (Only good thing I know is davinic, but its not open source)  \n\u2013 Visual effects + Vector graphics animation (No idea...)  \n\u2013 Frame by Frame animation + Tweened animation (no idea, have no experience)  \n\u2013 Videorecording (OBS, easy, its the best)  \n\u2013 Text editing (smth like indesign, also have nothing here rly)  \n\u2013 Coding (idk really)  \n\u2013 Ui design (best thing I know is figma.. not open source)  \n\n\nIve been going on and off while writing this and I kind of forgot what my main point was. I guess is there any software currently in development, or already accesible that focuses in any of those genres that really focuses on the user, the feel, and the quality of the software... If u guys think there is a better place for this kind of topic please let me know, im really interested in this.

He will say things like, \"Innit\" or \"Isn't it\" to no one's reply. I often wonder why barely anyone responds unless Sadhguru really emphasizes for them to do so. As someone in the Culinary Industry, when the head Chef asks us, \"Yes or No\", we reply immediately, \"Yes Chef\", \"No Chef\". Because of this I find myself answering for the audience as I listen. \"Yes, Sadhguru\", \"No, Sadhguru\". \n\nWhy do people not respond? Do I just not hear them respond in the audio? Is everyone so in awe of the man that they are stricken mute? \n\nI feel like the guy is looking for an \"Amen\", but none is given without pushing for it.
