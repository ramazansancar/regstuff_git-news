My mother tongue isn\u2019t english (although my English is very good) and I find it hard to think the mantra in a different language while listening to Sadhguru speak English. So in the last days I just think in English, I\u2019m just worried it won\u2019t \u201csink in\u201d as much as mother tongue?\n\n2. When Sadhguru speaks the mantras I try to think with him but sometimes it feels like his voice is loud enough to make it harder for me to think with him, so sometimes I just listen to him attentively and don\u2019t hear my own thought clearly. Is that ok? Or should I lower the volume and hear my thoughts distinctively?\n\nChanting:\n\n3. In the Aaaa chanting part, I can\u2019t really reach the specific musical tone Sadhguru voices. I can only do it if I go a scale higher which is kinda high pitched and I\u2019m worried it doesn\u2019t reach the same depth in the body it should reach. Should I just do a relatively lower tone that is different from his, or should I stick to his but a scale higher?\n\n4. When I chat I usually feel vibrations in my middle of the stomach but not exactly in the Dan Tien (3/4\u201d under belly button). Maybe I\u2019m not sensitive enough it because the whole stomach kinda vibrates but I don\u2019t have an obvious feeling of vibration in my lower abdomen.\n\nMandala:\n\n5. I\u2019m currently at 6 days streak, once a day. To complete a mandala I need 90 of these, but this week I\u2019m going to have a big schedule change and I might be able to start doing twice a day. That makes the Mandala shrink to 48 days, but I\u2019m already in the 90 days mandala, can I move to twice a day and start from 0 to 48 again? Will that be as beneficial? Open to any other way of going about this.\n\n6. Is there a benefit of doing it in a specific time of the day / same times every day? (I know that around 23:40-00:20 it\u2019s not recommended)\n\nThank you all so much!\n\ud83d\udd49\ufe0f", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Sadhguru/comments/196rt4p/isha_kriya_clarifications_language_chanting_tone/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": []}}};
