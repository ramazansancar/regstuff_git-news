By accurately locating and separating objects in images, segmentation enables deeper perception. Meta's SAM from last year was the first foundational model focused on segmentation, excelling at primary spatial perceptions like shapes and edges. However, full perception requires not just segmenting images but also semantic understanding and relationship inference within a single model.\n\nToday, we'd like to share Tokenize Anything via Prompting (TAP) \u2013 a perception-centered foundation model that uses visual prompts (point, box, sketch) to segment, recognize, and describe arbitrary regions simultaneously. This upgrades the prompt-based SAM into a foundation model that efficiently realizes spatial and semantic understanding of any area in a single visual model. [https://github.com/baaivision/tokenize-anything](https://github.com/baaivision/tokenize-anything)\n\nArchitecturally, TAP builds on SAM with a universal image decoder that jointly outputs segmentation masks and semantic tags. The masks handle segmentation while the tags predict corresponding labels and text descriptions. To address the lack of aligned \"segmentation-text\" data, TAP introduces the SemanticSA-1B dataset which implicitly integrates LAION-2B's semantics into SA-1B's segmentation data. Specifically, TAP leverages a 5B-parameter EVA-CLIP model trained on LAION-2B to predict a conceptual distribution over each segmented region in SA-1B. This distribution provides information-maximized semantic supervision to avoid training on highly biased pseudo-labels.\n\nTAP is expected to better support downstream applications, enabling use cases like self-driving, surveillance, or medical imaging.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5gv2cssr3zdc1.jpg?width=1509&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be09c84cc8d1b4acdb16022098c0593c90530777", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/19ct4l4/industry_a_visual_foundation_model_that_can/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Difference between homography (2d to 2d perspective transformation) and projective transformation (3d to 2d)", "summary": "Please elaborate on why perspective transformation is 2d to 2d while projective is 3d to 2d, though both denote yhe same transformation.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/19csr6p/difference_between_homography_2d_to_2d/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "What if I paid for all my free software?", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.cynicusrex.com/file/takemymoney.html", "author": "None"}, {"title": "23 lost skiers and snowboarders rescued in frigid temperatures in Killington, Vermont", "summary": "", "link": "https://apnews.com/article/killington-vermont-lost-skiers-snowboarders-rescued-4b781f65ef9c1f0fd2830d07a2e69857", "author": "None"}, {"title": "toc - Generate a table of contents from the comments of a file", "summary": "Hi all!\n\nI am sharing with the world a CLI utility I use often.  \n`toc` is like a `tree` for file contents, and it made me organize my code base in a more structured way.\n\nI got positive feedback from some friends, so I decided to make it public.\n\nGive it a try, I'd love to hear your opinions.\n\n\n\n[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/tableofcontents/)\n\n[Repo](https://github.com/AlphaJack/toc)", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/19cfk8k/toc_generate_a_table_of_contents_from_the/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Cancer Vaccine with Minimal Side Effects Nearing Phase 3 Clinical Trials", "summary": "", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Health/melanoma-cancer-vaccine-minimal-side-effects-nearing-phase/story?id=106521186", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Wolf bounce-back in Italy", "summary": "This is what 50 odd years on the protected species list does to a mf", "link": "https://i.redd.it/ylx0gsynxzdc1.png", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Shambhavi Mahamudra", "summary": "Namaskaram Everyone,\nI got initiated to Shambhavi Mahamudra yesterday, It felt good, I feel like i have done something right, my question is on dietary restrictions, nothing regarding this was discussed in the 2 days live session.
