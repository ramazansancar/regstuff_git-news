Coders can stay relevant by sticking to basics and best practices, finding the right AI-based tools, having clear and precise communications with AI assistants, and being critical of AI outputs.\n      AI coding assistants can help with code completion and generation but understanding how the code fits into a larger system and problem-solving remain vital human skills. Generative AI can aid in learning new programming languages and kick-starting small projects. However, coders should be wary of the risks, such as inaccurate code and security vulnerabilities, and should check AI-generated code critically.\n  \n\n\n\n  Full article: How Coders Can Survive\u2014and Thrive\u2014in a ChatGPT World - IEEE Spectrum\n", "link": "https://www.emergentmind.com/posts/how-coders-can-survive-and-thrive-in-a-chatgpt-world", "published_js": "2023-07-04", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Google's updated privacy policy states it can use public data to train its AI models", "summary": "Summary:\n  \n      Google has revised its privacy policy to clarify that it can use publicly available data to train its AI models.\n      This data could potentially be used to build features or full products like Google Translate, Bard, and Cloud AI capabilities.\n  \n\n\n\n  Full article: Google's updated privacy policy states it can use public data to train its AI models\n", "link": "https://www.emergentmind.com/posts/google-s-updated-privacy-policy-states-it-can-use", "published_js": "2023-07-04", "author": "None"}]}}, "Food_Health": {"https://www.newscientist.com/subject/health/feed/": {"feed": {"title": "New Scientist - Health"}, "entries": []}, "https://phys.org/rss-feed/biology-news/agriculture/": {"feed": {"title": "Agriculture news"}, "entries": [{"title": "A single molecule upsets symbiosis of bacteria and fungi", "summary": "A new study on the coexistence of bacteria and fungi shows that a mutually beneficial, functioning symbiosis can be very fragile.
