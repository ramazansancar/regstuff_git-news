This work explores the integration of diffusion models and Chain-of-Thought (CoT), a well-established technique to improve the reasoning ability in autoregressive language models. We propose **Diffusion-of-Thought** (**DoT**), allowing reasoning steps to diffuse over time through the diffusion process. In contrast to traditional autoregressive language models that make decisions in a left-to-right, token-by-token manner, DoT offers more flexibility in the trade-off between computation and reasoning performance. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DoT in multi-digit multiplication and grade school math problems. Additionally, DoT showcases promising self-correction abilities and benefits from existing reasoning-enhancing techniques like self-consistency decoding. Our findings contribute to the understanding and development of reasoning capabilities in diffusion language models.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1aq58wq/diffusion_of_thoughts_chainofthought_reasoning_in/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "3 years of work and 1 million users later: I'm gradually open-sourcing my \"Internet OS\"!", "summary": "Hi all!\n\nI'm slowly open-sourcing every part of my \"[internet OS]( under real, non-modified OSS licenses -- absolutely no \"open core\" or \"source available\" fake OSS crap.\n\nI was wondering if there is anyone here interested in joining us.
