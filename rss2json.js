I need to know the orientation and type of crates in order to place them in the correct orientation. I want to get into this stuff and already built a small gantry robot with a usb camera from 3d printer components.\n\n\\- I have one conveyor belt with multiple different kinds of crates coming.\n\n\\- The crates lay on one of the six possible sides meaning from a top down camera its guaranteed that you either see top, bottom, short side 1, short side 2, long side 1, long side 2 \n\n\\- rotation of the crate is random regardless of the side they lay on\n\n\\- lets say there is a large number of different crate types something like 100 (hypothetically)\n\nNow i have thought of two ways to do this:\n\nApproach 1: \n\nTrain an object detection model where every side of each type of crate its own class meaning you would have classes like for example: crateType1\\_bottom, crateType1\\_top ... and so on this means i would have 6 classes per crate type which means i would have to label 6 \\* 100 = 600 different classes.\n\nApproach 2: \n\nTrain a model that detects the bottoms and tops of crates in general then let the robot orient the crate how its supposed to be and then train a second model that just classifies the type of crate based on the top side of correctly oriented crates. Im not sure however if this would work especially if the model would be able to generalize over 100 types of crates but i think it could because the crates are relatively similar. Also this would require more than one camera since its not guaranteed that a top down camera sees either the top or bottom of a crate. This approach requires 6 classes for the general model and 100 classes for the classification which would make this a lot less work collecting and labeling data i think.\n\nI would like to hear your opinions or suggestions for different approaches maybe someone has some genius idea that im not thinking of .
