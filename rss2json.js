An accessibility solution.  \n\nExample: Tarik react YouTube video of a vct Match (EG vs G2 2024 vct Match Feb 25, 2024)\n\nIn an esports, or normal sports. Commentators\ud83d\udc65 often talk over each other. Most of them are good at keeping the vibe and understand how each other people's talk and rhythm along. This makes impact and clarity of each and every person in a watch party to be clearly heard and respected. This is the science of communication\ud83e\udec2.\n\nNow, here's a problem\ud83e\udee5. On YouTube(As of now = February 25, 2024), the auto-generated English option of subtitles mixed all the voices into one single subtitle. This makes \"subtitles\" an error\ud83e\udd2f of accessibility\ud83e\uddbb and not a \"service\"\ud83d\ude35\u200d\ud83d\udcab. \n\nIdea: can we divide subtitles just like some movie subtitles(some movies do it and their hard work would not go unnoticed by many people in this world. Using NLP, can we train the computers to understand, I.e. 5\u270b people ideologies. In my example, I'll take Tarik,som, fns, vct official analysts, broadcasters\ud83c\udfae etc. (sorry I do not know much about the vct broadcast scenario. But respect to yal'l for having passion for one thing in your life however small or big). So continuing, training these computers to understand '5' \u270b is a small  in an age of Artificial intelligence. So split up the conversation, with Advanced programming I think we can even add impact\ud83d\udca2 and subtleness\ud83c\udf43 to subtitles and add personality to subtitles. \n\nThis is an improvement of an existing ideology to help people with audatory problems, low cost streaming device problems, bad headphones, (imagine losing functionality of one ear bud and continuing consuming content in a single earbud. I believe they are many problems in algorithms which can make the viewing experience suboptimal_ In my opinion.\ud83d\ude01\n\nI would love it if someone can do it. If you are a kind person you will do justice to the task, and if you are a competitive person, you will do it efficiently, if you are a dumbdumb, you will take time but you will learn(it's the purpose of life anyway).

Many of you mentioned that there's usually a dedicated person managing the presentation to ensure the lyrics are advanced at the right moments.\n\nIn our small community, we face a challenge due to limited volunteers, which led me to explore the possibility of automating this process. With today's voice recognition technology, combined with song detection capabilities (similar to Shazam), it seems feasible to automatically scroll through the lyrics in real-time as the song progresses.\n\nI've developed a small prototype and found that it's indeed possible. However, refining this tool to be universally user-friendly is quite complex. Additionally, I can't offer it for free since it requires significant computing resources for voice recognition to run on powerful servers.\n\nThis brings me to my question for you: Would you find such a tool valuable, even if there's a cost involved? Your feedback is crucial as it will determine whether I continue to invest time and energy into this project or if I should consider discontinuing it.\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts.
