However, in this study, we  discovered that many layers of LLMs exhibit high similarity, and some  layers play a negligible role in network functionality. Based on this  observation, we define a metric called **Block Influence** (**BI**) to gauge the  significance of each layer in LLMs. We then propose a straightforward  pruning approach: layer removal, in which we directly delete the  redundant layers in LLMs based on their BI scores. Experiments  demonstrate that our method, which we call **ShortGPT**, significantly  outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in model pruning.  Moreover, ShortGPT is orthogonal to quantization-like methods, enabling  further reduction in parameters and computation.

The setup I currently have is a camera mounted on a 3D printed eyewear facing forwards towards the computer screen, and another facing the user\u2019s eyes for infrared eye tracking (not really the focus of this topic).\n\nI\u2019m using infinite line detection and extracting the intersection points with math to detect the corners of the screen (sometimes its off by a few pixels, but this is the most accurate solution I\u2019ve got for now, though I\u2019m open to more suggestions). I\u2019ve also experimented with april tag\u2019s camera pose estimation, which looked promising at first, however given my current setup, the april tags are too small for them to be detected at such a distance (roughly more than 50cm away from the screen) and low resolution (limited by memory buffer as it is an embedded system) and it would be impractical for me to print on massive april tags to place around the screen. \n\n[This is what the front facing embedded camera sees. The lines and their intersection points have been found on the embedded board and their pixel coordinates can be extracted for use.](\n\nAnyways, back to the problem: given that I have 4 corners of the computer screen in pixel coordinates, and I can find the focal length and horizontal and vertical field of view of the lens, how do I find the position and rotation of the camera relative to the screen, given that I know the size of the screen in real life? It all seems to make sense that all these factors are related but I just can\u2019t seem to piece it together. What math is involved in this and how do I apply it? Ideally, once I can get the position and rotation of the camera relative to the screen, I hope to be able to combine this with the other camera facing the eye, and determine at which point of the screen is the user looking at.\n\nI've read up a bit on camera projection matrices, however it seems those are meant for mapping a point in 3D space onto an image plane coordinate. \n\n Any help on this matter is greatly appreciated.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/computervision/comments/1bch5xd/detecting_position_and_rotation_of_an_embedded/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Most of the followers here sound like mainstream media !", "summary": "How come everytime someone asks or writes something your responses are so in tune and so alike with one another?!\n\n\"Oh don't share experiences,\n\nOh that doesn't matter what matters is the practice,\n\nOh you don't need that you just need to keep doing your practice,\"\n\nWth is wrong with you guys?!\n\nDo you understand that the magic behind yoga makes people want to practice it?\n\nHas any of you read the Autobiography of a Yogi?! \n\nThat book is amazing beautiful and magical !\n\nFull of amazing stories and experiences which makes a curious mind follow yoga.\n\nYou have there people having different kid of siddhis.\n\nWhile here everyone sounds fake and like a customer support of Isha.\n\nYou make yoga boring!\n\nShare experiences, share magical stories, share occult rituals, don't just quote Sadhguru words and act like you thought of that.
