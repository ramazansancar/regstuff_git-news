In addition to OpenTelemetry tracing, you can use Grafana and Prometheus to investigate how your pipeline operates. Developers can export their custom metrics as well.\n* **Buffer adapter**. A special intermediary adapter, allowing to survive traffic bursts and pipeline slowdowns. It implements a mechanism allowing the video processing deferring by slow pipeline elements. The adapter has Prometheus/Grafana integration, so you always know how many elements await processing. It is based on RocksDB.\n* **Compile-only mode**. When the pipeline is launched for the first time, it compiles models in TensorRT engines. It can easily take minutes. Previously, developers could not separate compilation and evaluation. Now they can.\n* **Shutdown handler in PyFunc**. This new API allows handling pipeline shutdown operations properly to release resources and notify 3rd-party systems about the termination.\n* **Message filtering on Ingress and Egress**. This advanced feature allows developers to modify raw encoded streams and their metadata with simple callbacks. For example, you can select only key frames for processing and drop the rest or remove video pieces without detected objects.\n* **Model post-processing on GPU.** With a new feature, developers can instruct the framework to access model output tensors directly from GPU memory without downloading them to the CPU memory.\n* **GPU memory representation functions**. In the release, we provide functions for conversion memory buffers between OpenCV GpuMat, PyTorch GPU tensors, and CuPy tensors.\n* **Advanced object attribute modification operations**. In the release, we implemented a set of new operations allowing developers to modify object attributes conveniently.\n* **Queue utilization API for PyFunc**. Savant allows adding queues between PyFuncs to implement parallel processing and traffic burst management. With the release, we implemented a new API allowing developers to access queues deployed in the pipeline to request their utilization.\n\nFull release [notes](\n\nDon\u2019t forget to join our\u00a0[Discord]( where we help users.
