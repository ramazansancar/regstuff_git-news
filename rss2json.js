The project we acquired was a single developer's day job for around a decade, and I guess because he was a solo developer, he rarely saw any need to comment his code, since he was the one who wrote it-- I'm sure we all can relate to a certain extent.\n\nAnyways, the scope of this project is relatively immense-- 1500 source files, around 500K LOC. I wrote a quick script to count and categorize all of the text characters in the project in order to give context for this post; 97% of all meaningful (non-whitespace, non-semicolon, etc) characters in the project are source code tokens, while the remaining 3% of characters are comments. There is little to no documentation external to the project, either-- whatever insight is to be gleamed here is found solely within the 1500 source files we've received.\n\nThat being said, the source code itself is relatively self-explanatory-- the few comments found throughout the project are almost all found near code snippets of high complexity, and everywhere else the author tended to use verbose and descriptive naming patterns for variables, methods, classes etc.\n\nSo, given these aforementioned qualities of this project, I think it might be a decent idea to try to offload some of the documentation efforts onto some sort of LLM or AI service. The features / capabilities that I believe will be most important in my company's case here are the following:\n\n- The tool should be capable of either (A) writing inline comments (javadoc style for methods, line comments wherever else is appropriate) in the source code itself, or (B) writing external \"sidecar\" files (e.g. a source file located at com/example/SomeClass.java would have a \"sidecar\" documentation file generated at com/example/SomeClass.md)\n\n- The tool should be capable of finding references to symbols across the project to glean more context as to what they are used for-- I'm imagining the tool looking at some method with a non-descriptive name and opaque functionality, then finding a common pattern in the contexts where the method is called, and using that common pattern to inform whatever documentation the tool writes for the method.\n\n- The tool should be capable of taking git history and/or commit messages into account, as for this project specifically it seems a great deal of the \"story\" behind the source code is recorded in it's git history.\n\nSo, with all that being said, my question: Where might I find a tool with some (or hopefully all) of my desired capabilities? If no such tool exists, my company isn't averse to spending some developer hours on writing this for us (e.g. some script that combines a source code parser with OpenAI API calls to generate the outputs that we are looking for), but in the event that anyone has gone down this seemingly dark and uncharted road, I'd be interested in hearing whatever advice or tips you guys might have for me.\n\nCheers\n\n-----\n\nCrossposts:\n\n[r/LocalLLaMA](\n\n[r/artificial](\n\n[r/ChatGPT](\n\n[r/agi](\n\n[r/automate](\n\n[r/AskProgramming](", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/LanguageTechnology/comments/1ar68z9/recommendations_for_code_documentation_generation/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Archaeologists in Greece might have finally identified the bodies of Alexander the Great's father, brother and son", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/ancient-tomb-really-does-hold-alexander-the-greats-father-controversial-study-claims", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Are learned interest point/feature detectors used much in industry for SLAM/ego-motion?", "summary": "Over the past few years some really cool papers came out regarding deep-learned feature extraction and descriptor generation for things like sparse indirect SLAM and Visual Odometry. Examples that come to mind are LIFT, SuperPoint and UnsuperPoint.\n\nHistorically more classical extractors like FAST (I know technically still \"learned\", but you know what I mean) and descriptors have shown more prominence in this domain. That isn't to say that I haven't seen deep learning featuring in SLAM systems (Andrew Davison's lab has some really cool work) but I've not really seen anything resembling a deep-learned feature detector used in a SLAM system.\n\nI've been wondering why this is. It could be that since the development of good SLAM systems is more profitable now (especially with the rise of VR/AR) that people don't tend to shout about their incremental improvements or want to give away their special sauce as part of their integration. Maybe learned feature detectors are being used but they're trade secrets. It's also possible that despite the promise of more robust features and correspondences, certain practical limitations have gotten in the way.\n\nDoes anyone else have any input on this?

I had wanted to try out warp, but the lack of tmux -CC integration threw off my workflow so much, I couldn't even give it a fair try.", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/1ar7c9z/anybody_know_of_any_linux_or_windows_terminal/", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Archaeologists discover rare medallion with Roman emperor's likeness", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.newsweek.com/rare-medallion-roman-emperor-found-grave-1870067", "author": "None"}, {"title": "From humble beginnings to becoming the world's most-watched spiritual festival!", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1aqplyg", "author": "None"}, {"title": "The skull of a 5,000-year-old Neolithic bog-body from Denmark was of a man who came down originally from the far north of Scandinavia, near the Arctic Circle", "summary": "", "link": "https://www.livescience.com/archaeology/skull-of-neolithic-bog-body-from-denmark-was-smashed-by-8-heavy-blows-in-violent-murder", "author": "None"}, {"title": "How to get started with text to speech without selling my soul to the devil?", "summary": "I've looked at both Amazon web services and Google cloud services but the billing is so hard to understand and getting to talk to an actual human sales representative about their complicated billing is even harder.\n\nMy use case is simple.  All I want is a reasonable quality Dutch voice for work on a personal project.  I am not concerned if it is not entirely free but I am not wanting to spend thousands of dollars as indicated by some of the confusing pricing from Amazon and Google.  Even worse is the fact that in order to sign up with a \"free\" plan you have to enter your credit card details.  I'm not really in favour of such heavy handed sign ups on a \"free\" trial.\n\nMy project is basically just to set up some audio style flash cards to aid in learning the Dutch vocabulary.  I thought it would be a relatively exercise that I could knock out a working prototype in about a week but now I am overwhelmed just by the billing part of it.\n\nAny idea of what my options are at this point?", "link": "https://www.reddit.com/r/speechtech/comments/1aqxukr/how_to_get_started_with_text_to_speech_without/", "author": "None"}]}}, "Sport": {"edition.cnn.com%20sport": {"feed": {"title": "edition.cnn.com"}, "entries": [{"title": "These young athletes were bound for stardom until a mysterious condition derailed their running careers", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">These young athletes were bound for stardom until a mysterious condition derailed their running careers</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDIvMTUvc3BvcnQvcmVsYXRpdmUtZW5lcmd5LWRlZmljaWVuY3ktbWFyeS1jYWluLXBpcHBhLXdvb2x2ZW4tc3B0LWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBb2h0dHBzOi8vYW1wLmNubi5jb20vY25uLzIwMjQvMDIvMTUvc3BvcnQvcmVsYXRpdmUtZW5lcmd5LWRlZmljaWVuY3ktbWFyeS1jYWluLXBpcHBhLXdvb2x2ZW4tc3B0LWludGwvaW5kZXguaHRtbA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-02-15", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Qatar Open: Naomi Osaka reaches first quarterfinal in almost two years", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Qatar Open: Naomi Osaka reaches first quarterfinal in almost two years</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDIvMTUvc3BvcnQvcWF0YXItb3Blbi1uYW9taS1vc2FrYS1maXJzdC1xdWFydGVyZmluYWwtaW50bC1zcHQvaW5kZXguaHRtbNIBAA?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-02-15", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Detroit Pistons player arrested and cited after punching opponent before game", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Detroit Pistons player arrested and cited after punching opponent before game</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDIvMTUvc3BvcnQvZGV0cm9pdC1waXN0b25zLWlzYWlhaC1zdGV3YXJ0LWFycmVzdGVkLXNwdC1pbnRsL2luZGV4Lmh0bWzSAWRodHRwczovL2FtcC5jbm4uY29tL2Nubi8yMDI0LzAyLzE1L3Nwb3J0L2RldHJvaXQtcGlzdG9ucy1pc2FpYWgtc3Rld2FydC1hcnJlc3RlZC1zcHQtaW50bC9pbmRleC5odG1s?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-02-15", "author": "None"}, {"title": "Kansas City Chiefs soak up the love during Valentine\u2019s Day Super Bowl parade", "summary": "<a href=\" target=\"_blank\">Kansas City Chiefs soak up the love during Valentine\u2019s Day Super Bowl parade</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=\"#6f6f6f\">", "link": "https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vZWRpdGlvbi5jbm4uY29tLzIwMjQvMDIvMTQvc3BvcnQva2Fuc2FzLWNpdHktY2hpZWZzLXBhcmFkZS1zdXBlci1ib3dsLXBhdHJpY2stbWFob21lcy1zcHQtaW50bC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFxaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyNC8wMi8xNC9zcG9ydC9rYW5zYXMtY2l0eS1jaGllZnMtcGFyYWRlLXN1cGVyLWJvd2wtcGF0cmljay1tYWhvbWVzLXNwdC1pbnRsL2luZGV4Lmh0bWw?oc=5", "published_js": "2024-02-14", "author": "None"}]}}};
