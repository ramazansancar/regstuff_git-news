If I have my own dataset and want to add new knowledge to an existing model (Mixtral, etc.), should I go with pre-training, instruct tuning, or fine-tuning?

There are 2 rows of 14 racks, each one with multiple vertical levels.\n\nAll of the inventory is heavily standardized with barcodes, and each rack also has \"location barcodes\" stuck to the physical rack locations. We plan to be using ZBar to identify/scan QR/barcodes for both the navigation system (detailed below) and for scanning the actual inventory barcodes.\n\nThe output is extremely simple. After the cycle is complete - send an excel file of the results via email, and stored in a \"Log\" feature of the UI.\n\n* Experience I/we have: Web Development, AWS Cloud services, Computer Vision (still beginner/intermediate)\n* Experience we don't: Anything about drone software and hardware\n\nI have been spending copious amounts of time research what the best hardware and software combinations will be ideal for our context - and I am still not confident in a system design.\n\nI do not want to get vendor-locked by a proprietary drone SDK, so that leads me to consider Ardupilot, but I am not sure if even those compatible drones will be powerful enough to handle on-board image processing. We could just stream it as a video to the cloud to then be processed via OpenCV or PyZbar, but I would much rather realtime processing, for many reasons.\n\n**Important - Navigation Methodology**\n\n* I have tinkered with many different methodologies we could use for drone navigation. Given that we only have 1 semester to develop this solution, among other limitations, I have decided the best option is to place \"Waypoints\" around the warehouse that are QR codes that hold their coordinates, which fit into a greater \"grid\" data structure which will be a 1-to-1 representation of the physical warehouse and literally all of its inventory locations on each rack.\n* Cloud image processing  \n\n   * Once the drone sees a waypoint QR code, it will process it, which should trigger a Lambda function in AWS to execute, which will then provide flight path directions to the drone to continue towards completing its current task\n* Onboard image processing (preferred but not sure if feasible)  \n\n   * Same flow, just will be occurring onboard, in realtime (??)\n* For either, we may use an A\\* algorithm on the grid data struct to dynamically generate optimized flight paths (remember this warehouse is massive and the racks go up like 60 feet), but we will stick to simple, fairly hard-coded flight paths that rely heavily on fixed directions that are stored in the QR Code \"waypoints\"\n* This is important because obviously the latency from doing CONSTANT cloud communications would likely make this drone's navigation very slow, eating up its battery life. This is a main reason why onboard computing is heavily preferred, I think.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nBelow I am going to try to detail our system as much as possible for you all to be able to provide helpful guidance -\n\n**Budget: &lt;$2,000**\n\n**System Design/Flow**\n\n**User Interface**\n\n* Web-App - some JavaScript framework, probably Next.js which will communicate with A) a cloud instance, B) Drone (via Wi-Fi), etc...\n   * Much prefer the development experience here versus a Raspberry Pi Touchscreen UI. Also not having to force them into using a physical touchscreen is a big plus. Also opening the door to a mobile app in the future, etc...\n\n**Drone Hardware**\n\n* Cannot use DJI due to data security concerns.\n* I don't really want to totally develop in a properietary SDK as we will get vendor-locked or hit limitations (remember our navigation methodology? i don't know if these SDKs will play nice with it)\n   * I really like the Autel Evo II and Parrot Amafi, but I'm very hesitant to use our budget on either\n* Ardupilot-compatible drone\n   * I really just don't know which to choose. We need 30+ minute flight time, a very high quality camera that can handle low-light pre and post processing well, and ideally one where we can add a Jetson Nano or a RPi for onboard computer vision computing, processing and decision making with the pilot controller (??? sry i dont know drone stuff very well yet)\n   * I am simply not confident that our system is feasible for these drones. I imagine we will definitely need to install a Jetson Nano or RPi, but even then, how performant would it be?\n\n**Cloud Services (if onboard drone computing isn't possible/ideal)**\n\n* AWS S3 buckets for the outputs to be handled, then some AWS messaging service to email the excel files, etc...\n* May use websocket connections or something very low-latency, if possible/needed\n\nThe biggest deciding factor in this entire development really seems to be how we handle drone navigation, given our scope and limitations.\n\nAdditional thoughts:\n\n* I've been researching SLAM for navigation, and it looks so very awesome. The thing is that this warehouse is really not a complex nor does its layout really ever change. Additionally I am not sure if it would be out of our scope to implement such a navigation system.\n* I am trying to make this system as generalized/agnostic as possible - what I mean by this is - not using the semantics from this company's warehouse's environment, nor just essentially buying a heavily pre-configured solution.\n   * This way our system will be modular and extensible, and actually belong to us (also for educational/research reasons)\n\n**I greatly appreciate any advice/considerations/suggestions/perspective on drone selection in this context.
