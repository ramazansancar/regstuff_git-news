Meanwhile I updated it every once in a while. It's not really comparable to the big helpdesk systems out there, but it's also not intended to be, since the market is already overflooded with such kind of systems. \n\nI just figured I want to share the GitHub repo here with the opensource community, because maybe others have also a use for this. I personally used it back in the days for my first business where I needed to support customers here and there, while also granting others to use it for their customers as well. It's a SaaS system, so everyone could sign up for a workspace and start supporting their customers. \n\nWhat channels of customer support are available?\n\n* The simplest way is to send your customers a link to your personal workspace support form that customers can fill out to submit requests. You can customize it a bit to fit your needs. When a ticket is created, customers can reply further messages via a conversation form.\n* You can specify your SMTP / IMAP settings of a mailbox, so customer support can be done via e-mail. Customers can send a message to your inbox which will then be automatically parsed into a ticket. Replying to e-mails is also possible, so customers as well as agents can just answer an e-mail and the ticket system handles this.\n* If you have your own contact form on your website, then you can also create a ticket via the REST API from your backend. \n* You can also embed a JavaScript widget in your website. Then there will be a support icon button in the bottom right corner of the screen. When clicking on it, a support contact form shows up where your customers can send a support request.\n\nOther features?\n\n* Manage multiple groups and agents\n* Search feature\n* Different ticket types that you can specify (default are Service Request, Incident &amp; Change)\n* Agent dashboard with various information\n* Assign tickets to groups and agents\n* Many more\n\nHere is the GitHub repo: [https://github.com/danielbrendel/dnyHelpRealm](https://github.com/danielbrendel/dnyHelpRealm)\n\nHere is a demo video (does not reflect changes of past months since it's a bit old): [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jncm7zczfdY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jncm7zczfdY) \n\nHave a nice day!
