In fact, it is more of a robotics project -- does this hurt my chances at getting into computer vision for a PhD?\n\nThe research projects I am looking into:\n\n- LLM+Computer Vision: Some project on multimodal stuff that lets you do visual query and answer stuff on images, but for hyperspectral images (so a special type of images, not normal ones).\n\n- Incentivizing shape bias in CNNs: This is about biasing a CNN to reason based on shape over texture, in hopes of making it more robust.\n\n- Neurosymbolic AI: This seems like a project involving the construction of a simulation environment for neurosymbolic AI (I am not too familiar with this topic). They want to explore uses of generative AI to help with this, then they want to be able to train models using few examples (few shot learning), and then there's some additional stuff on RL which I did not completely understand. Not really computer vision focused compared to the others.\n\nI feel some sort of bias towards the last project solely because of how weird it is compared to my past experience. I have never done much with reinforcement learning or neurosymbolic AI. Additionally, it is being done in one of the top departments in my school (so there's prestige perhaps, though I honestly don't think it matters as much as the content of the work I do -- any lab should be respectable enough).\n\nThe LLM and Computer Vision one looks cool, though my first task (should I accept the project) is to benchmark other models on this task. I don't have too much experience with this task -- is it particularly difficult (I have never worked much with LLMs, only pure computer vision stuff)?
