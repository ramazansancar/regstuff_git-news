For my linguistics studies, I specialized in semantics, albeit from a more theoretical perspective (metaphysics of language, misinformation, truth, etc). While I often applied programming skills to research projects I did in linguistics classes, I never had enough time in my schedule to take specific computational linguistics classes, so I'm excited to have the chance to study it now.
